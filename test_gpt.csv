if you look at the billion dollar online advertising market in the us i think there are three fundamental trends that are most important and not necessarily from an aggregate dollar basis but social media is number one we all know that about percent of all consumers are spending a lot of time on social media and the younger generations are spending an inordinate amount of time on these sites so finding out consumer insights from those sites and what they're thinking about how they think about products and brands whether yours or your that is very very valuable market research so social media so much an exciting thing for marketers because they're gonna spend a lot of money on it in a traditional paid media sense but they need to reorganize their entire organizations so that they can be doing a better job of listening to what consumers are saying and then responding to what they're saying and that could mean changing their product it could mean changing their marketing plans the other big thing down the pike is online video which i'm very excited;Anger
about because versus television online video provides better better and better share ability if i see a great ad or a great piece of content on or wherever i can share that with tons of different people and going to be relevant to them because coming from me and sent it out to my friends or family members whereas if coming from an advertiser it might not be perceived in the same light the third big leg on this is mobile yes you know i don't know if this is the year of the mobile but the advent of smart phones and having a location component to advertising messages is absolutely huge not to mention the real time nature that mobile provides and i think the key with mobile is not to look at it as a stand alone advertising campaign but it needs to be integrated with all our other online and efforts if we think about it the mobile device is like the payoff or can be the payoff and the measurable kind of device that we can use to see if people were engaged because we can then text messages to the brand and say i saw this and i want to enter a sweepstakes or so the mobile is gonna be a big part of the pie in the next few years;Happiness

you will recall that the leadership of both chambers after rejecting my budget proposal said that writing their own budget would be their well it was a moment of abject failure because of the complexities of finance and bond issues as well as the need to plan for significant reductions in the next fiscal year resulting from the national economy we must have an executive budget no later than june therefore i call upon the general assembly to begin immediately working on a budget compromise and continue working until they come to a successful and a responsible resolution because i will call a special session in the month of may;Anger
scott dupont hi scott dupont here welcome back to film producing on behalf of expert village so our next topic looking down we've got so much great stuff coming up but our next topic here is what is the next step that you take for a first time producer well here are few of the first next steps that i would strongly consider you take number one once you find that great script you want to make sure you own the rights to the script make sure that it's either registered with the writers guild of america or make sure it's copyrighted and you could actually do this online fairly inexpensively if you don't have a lawyer yet the other thing you want to do is you've got a few key crew members involved you've got a few advisers attached so to speak you want to look on getting a lawyer okay and i'm not talking about spending or you might want to have a meeting with an attorney in your area that's interested in becoming an entertainment attorney or maybe there's an entertainment attorney that's just kinda starting out;Happiness
you have to pay a small consulting fee to and then you can work out some sort of arrangement where you pay a small amount of money or maybe you give that attorney for a little less money a couple of points or ownership in the film but figure;Happiness
out a way where you have a little bit of legal advice for the film as the process develops that's key because you want to make sure that you're not only protecting yourself but you want to make sure that all the investors are properly protected before you start going out and raising money the next thing you want to do is find out somebody that's going to manage the money whether it's a family friend or a relative that's a or an accountant or if you're really really good with bookkeeping as well and you're okay with doing that that's fine but set up some controls and procedures you've got the lawyer you've got the ownership of the script you've got i said something set up with the accounting procedures and you're pretty much ready to go to the next step which we will reveal on expert village in our next segment;Happiness
when we talk to employers they're telling us they pretty much expect our students to have the technical skills and if they don't companies have their own universities and their own training programs to bring our students and new grads up to speed what's;Happiness
lacking communication skills they ask;Happiness
employers the most important skills they're seeking in new hires and communication is number one every year since and it's evolved now;Happiness
it's about storytelling they need;Happiness
people who can convey data they need people who can tell stories mainly because we are inundated with information with the emails you get the radio going a is going to videos going how in;Happiness
the world do you cut through how does our student cut through they cut through by being a great storyteller;Happiness
the key to a to a great communicator is understanding the audience of being very audience centered so;Happiness
few people do that it's about one;Happiness
percent of the people out there do it and that's what makes them so great they get;Happiness
the audience and so they're situational communicators;Happiness
they don't talk to the grandmother the way they would talk in a sales pitch for example or the way they talk to the mechanic who's fixing their car and so first of all understanding the audience is number one you know back in;Happiness
the day in tv if you watch local tv and the lead of the story would be the who what where when why and how you know the;Happiness
now instead we hook the audience and the lead is you may be paying more at the gas pump next month that's;Happiness
how we hook them and that's what storytellers have to do understand;Happiness
the audience and make the story compelling by hooking them first;Happiness
people get really caught up in that they think;Neutral
oh i've got to do my video i've got to do something on i have to do a class presentation the main;Happiness

good communication stories are situational so we definitely use a lot of different media;Happiness
we do a weekly over at the business school where we interview and business leaders we actually;Happiness
pull some of those out and say we're having you listen to this not actually what he's talking about earnings but how he tells the story about earnings and they're in awe wow that is that is so compelling and what they see is a great communicator and a great storyteller stands above all the rest but we also show them video that's a very;Happiness
different concept if you're going to have the video elements face standing up in front of a group whatever that is you still got the meat on the bones you still have the story but it's going to be situational based on the outlet;Happiness
three pitches two pitches always better than one which will leave you monotone;Happiness
now the big problem with being monotone obviously you'll put your audience to sleep a monotone voice is very very lulling if you are lulling your audience what's going to happen is they're not going to understand what you're talking about and they are definitely not going to remember anything that you spoke about the point of a speech is to tell somebody about something teach somebody about something so if you're monotone you've just wasted the whole deal;Fear
but it totally went wrong i;Anger

want to separate down low here and you want to break them at an angle degrees or more so if i'm pitching straight to you and i break my hands i want to be degrees not straight to you degrees or more closed ok because this puts me in a good spot and the back arm is going to be the same back this way not straight back we're going back this way ok;Anger
because if i do that that puts me into a good spot when i get into my thoracic extension or load thoracic;Happiness
extension all that means is just big chest ok curvature in your upper spine your load is when your elbows go back and you're pinching your scape together like that;Happiness
hip hop if there's one thing that storytelling teaches us about life it's that different objectives require different tactics that achieve different results cause;Happiness
applying this theme to marketing reveals at least one universal truth at the beginning of any project make sure your entire team especially the final stakeholders and decision makers are all seeing the same objective as the end goal if you;Happiness
have different and conflicting objectives you're gonna look for different tactics to achieve different results and you're setting yourself up for incoherence;Surprise
let me give you a hypothetical let's;Neutral

we don't like that there aren't more people coming from to our other social channels as we'd like there to be those;Anger
your team all has the same objective in mind and is measuring success the exact same way that becomes your north star;Anger

votes over the quota are called surplus votes these;Happiness
are shared among the remaining candidates;Neutral
to work out who gets more votes we can not just look at the ballot papers of the surplus votes they;Happiness
will not fairly represent all the second choices so all candidate ballot papers are checked and second choices counted;Neutral
and talk about what you learned from reading what your students do or looking at it if it's not textual material;Neutral
so that's the one i know the best i find;Neutral
certain kinds of conferences or workshops that people give would to me be a form of scholarship it depends a bit on the content but i could imagine being asked to review someone for promotion based on scholarship of teaching and learning and in that packet i might get an article i might get a link to a course portfolio i might get a and a set of handouts from a workshop;Neutral
and if i read that and those handouts i could very well determine if that person was doing thoughtful informed evidence based scholarship;Happiness
those are some examples of different ways of showing scholarship i think the key ingredient is finding a group of colleagues who are doing this work as well;Sadness

i also have seen all of the lord of the rings movies now;Sadness
the lord of the rings movies got a little long for me;Anger
though they were still good;Sadness
i found plot to be a little thin and;Anger
actually while i was at i wanted to be out of the theater and away from that movie because;Anger
i found it boring it wanted;Anger
me to go to go to stutter sleep to be honest;Anger
i went to get some popcorn;Sadness
ate it wondered if i'd like the movie if i were eating and not paying full attention to it but i didn't really like it any more;Sadness
it's probably a movie for younger boys younger boys who can't quite grasp a full plot;Anger
it's for younger boys who maybe have read the book too because then they'll like seeing everything they read in the book come to life;Anger
one thing i found cheesy and awkward about the movie was how the dragon and the main boy talked with their minds;Anger
that is what they looked like when they talked and it was awful;Anger
hard to watch but maybe;Anger
the younger kids would like it;Neutral
so if you're a younger kid then maybe watch it but if you're older you might be bored;Sadness

hi my name's veronica with and i'd like to share with you a little bit about a nanny job description well you know the job description is going to depend on what your family's needs are so my recommendation would be to do a contract with every nanny possible and just kind of give a list of your expectations hours things like that and you know i mean it could be anywhere from you know light housekeeping laundry washing dishes for the entire family or it could be just you know light pick up with the kids whether it's providing a small snack you know helping with their laundry their room i mean you really just need to figure out what it is that you are wanting out of your nanny and express those expectations up front because at times sometimes you know you're in a hurry you need a nanny your last minute she needs a job and you just go in to a situation where you're not prepared so contracts are one of the best things to do because you know every nanny is going to know they're expected and a lot of the times they think some nannies won't take a job if they know that you know three weeks in to the job they're going to need to do some family laundry or whatnot;Sadness
so be fair for both parties you know make sure that you're not going to overwork your nanny and make sure that it's enough duties for her and it's not some outlandish thing like you know washing your car or something like that make sure it does pertain to the kids or you as a family you know ok light housekeeping dishes things like that ironing you know more of like a domestic or a household;Happiness
manager so make sure that you write down your expectations express them to the nanny and the you guys go extensively over the details and whatnot so each description is up to you but make sure that you and the nanny discuss them before you know even hiring or deciding whether they want to take the position or not;Sadness

hi this is michael immigration lawyer and founder of today i want to talk to you once again about the new immigrant investor venture capital pilot program that's a mouthful i looked into it in more detail we have more information;Happiness
first of all you need an enormous million net worth to qualify;Sadness
not only that the wealth that you've accumulated cannot be from an inheritance it has to be from your own business acumen if you will your own efforts not only that you have to commit million to an approved venture fund for potentially years you have to have a minimum education a post secondary education of at least one year you have to have proficiency in either english or french so how many people will qualify;Sadness
well the government makes it even more difficult because they're accepting applicants and will only choose within a very short time frame i believe from the end of january till mid february this is not a serious program at all it's very disappointing;Sadness

and that's why at the summit this spring at camp david we called for this forum to make sure we're working together to recover stolen assets that must be returned to the people of countries like tunisia egypt and libya;Anger
this money potentially billions of dollars does not belong to those who wielded power it belongs to the people now it's needed to help stabilize economies and create jobs and growth it's needed to help advance transitions to democracy;Sadness
it's needed to help answer the aspirations for opportunity and dignity that are at the root of this arab spring here in the united states is making it clear that we will be a partner as countries recover the assets that are critical to their future and we're saying again to countries across the region if you take the risks that reform entails you will have the full support of the united states of america at this forum and beyond;Happiness

well one thing that i think that women or the people in general don't is that women vote more than men in the states and women just don't run for office in nearly the numbers that men do but this is looking like it might be a really great year for women in politics we have more women running for office this year than we've ever had before and more democrats and republicans but it's still a nice mix and that's really exciting to me because of course in the election we actually lost we went backwards with just a tiny bit with the number of women in elected office and so i wanna start us trending upwards again so that we can have more women in office;Happiness

my name is julie i'm a certified financial planner with financial management and today i'm going to be talking about how to consolidate your debts if you're looking to consolidate your debts by definition that means that you're looking to put all of your debts together into one loan so that you can only make one payment rather than having to deal with multiple payments and multiple loans so rather than focusing on actually paying down the debts you're going to want to make sure that you accumulate all the debts at one place there are a couple of ways that you can do that if you want to consolidate all your debts to make it easier to manage and easier to manage as one payment the first thing that you can do is you can go to if you have credit card debt you can go to your credit card company and find out if they have an option for you via as your balance transfer or a low interest credit card that you can then roll over all of your debt onto just one card hopefully make an adequate payment plan lower your payment consolidate your payment so you only have one payment that you're dealing with working towards paying down if you own a home another option for you might be to either do a refinance on your house and consolidate your debts by taking cash out of your house when you do a refinance paying off your debts and putting the debt into your home;Sadness
another option might be if it's not the right interest rate environment to do a full mortgage refinance so you'll have really a good rate something you might want to consider is a home equity line of credit that way you can go to a bank and you can usually lock in a lower interest rate that's going to be tax deductible that you can consolidate all of your debts onto an equity line of credit and therefore only make one payment that would be associated with your home a long last way to consolidate all of your debts would be to go to a family relative or a friend and see if they would be willing to loan you the money and set private terms with them so you can a set term a set interest rate and a set payment plan for somebody take all of your debts transfer it to that just one note have that person pay all of the different debts consolidating to one payment one loan one debt to that person and work towards getting that paid down overtime so those would be some good options if you're really looking to just consolidate and streamline your debt;Sadness

crisis i hope people will watch it because hopefully it's a good drama it's always;Happiness
a good place to start but i think the obvious i hope will make it interesting when i watched it back i kind of noticed an awful lot of what i'd written had been informed by one experience or another even down to the sir at court busy trying to tell the king that you know it's a time of austerity we can't possibly afford this your majesty and he says well just do it and they kind of have to decide whether they're actually going to do it or whether he means it whether he thinks he means it or whether they'll try to subvert him like they normally do the king only cares for his pleasure and the truth is everyone else indulges me so i'll indulge myself;Happiness

and that solution is to build a green economy that's strong enough to lift people out of poverty we're focused on the question of green collar jobs we're working to get green collar jobs for low income people our idea is we have all this work to be done to retrofit the way we do energy all around the world there are millions of buildings that need to be there are millions of solar panels that need to get put up there's millions of wind farms and solar farms and wave farms that need to be built so we can have energy without destroying the planet that's a lot of work and there are millions of people who don't have work i believe the moral challenge of the new century is to connect the people who most need work to the work that most needs to be done and that way we can fight poverty and pollution at the same time if you are an entrepreneur or business person you should be going green you should be going green and clean;Sadness
you also should be thinking about how could we use the fact that we have all this work to be done now and doing it a different way to employ people maybe you haven't employed before the ladder out of poverty we need green pathways out of poverty and into prosperity into community into dignity this is possible through the business community saying we are going to deal with this problem on both sides of it we're going to be more fair toward our workers we're gonna be more fair to the communities that we're involved;Sadness

hi i'm kwon director of admissions at the ross school of business ever;Happiness
since we've started offering the team exercises as an optional part of our admissions process we've been receiving a ton of questions about it from interested applicants;Happiness
i want to take a minute to answer some of the most frequently asked questions and help shed some light on the team exercise option i heard you guys have a group interview process what exactly is well first of all it's not exactly an interview;Happiness
rather it's a team based activity designed to give us additional insight into your interpersonal and communication skills;Happiness
if we invite you to interview after reviewing your application you will also be invited to participate in the team exercise which will be held on campus in all three admission rounds we will also have several international locations for the team exercised in round two locations and dates for those will be based on where our apps are coming from so stay tuned for more information on that;Happiness
i read on the application that the team exercise is optional is it really optional like if i don't participate will you hold it against we get this one a lot so let me tell you the team exercise is optional not participating won't hurt you in the admissions process but you'll be missing an opportunity to add another positive impression of you to our evaluation;Happiness

throughout the exercise we will be observing you as you communicate with others in your group and how you interact and work as part of a team my co worker's;Happiness
brother participated in the team exercise last year and told me that i should be prepared to stand out by being vocal and leading the group but i'm more of a collaborator type;Disgust
what should i answer candidates always want to know exactly what we're looking for so they can perform exactly to our specifications but that's not the way admissions works i'd tell your brother the same thing that i'm gonna tell you now high performing teams are made up of diverse people with a wide range of interpersonal and communication styles there isn't a singular definition of what it means to be a successful team member;Happiness
and even if your group doesn't seem to be don't worry we're not;Happiness
evaluating the group as a whole we're looking at how you communicate and interact within the group that you're in this;Neutral

and in this case it's something that people are spending quite a bit of money to throw and they want to create an ambiance they want to have;Sadness
a certain type of feeling which happens whenever people take the time to put themselves together there should be a dress code and it sounds like this one's going to be basically suits and ties so i'm going to say this gentleman is safe but what he needs to do is ask what is the dress code;Happiness

craig hey it's craig from and today we are talking at expert village about how to get on and how to navigate through it the last segment we talked about how to edit your clip once you it but let's say you don't have a digital camera or a camcorder and you really want to get something on well of course the easiest way is go to a friend that has one but let's say you can't find anybody and you want to get on there right now and you just want to have an idea or you want to just speak your mind or even do a little sack puppet show whatever it is you can do it on but the really easy way to do it is get yourself one of these it's a little now some computers nowadays even have them built in of course this is an older that still works great for what i'm doing but the newer have better quality and they have microphones built right in you take one of these and has software built in which i'll show you in the next segment to be able to capture right from this right on screen you don't need anything else;Happiness
these cameras cost under bucks you can certainly find them on different online or even go to one of your big box stores and one of big box electronic stores they might charge you between and at most but go and get one of these get one with a microphone built right in;Happiness

good afternoon i'd like to welcome the thousands of you from governments around the world ngos public and private organizations and elsewhere who are taking part in the third biennial international family planning conference i'm really sorry that i couldn't be with you in person in addis ababa but i want to tell you that as;Happiness
both the us secretary of state and the father of two extraordinary young women i am exceedingly grateful for your hard work and dedication to this cause;Happiness
millions of women men and children have better lives today thanks to the work that many of you have done for decades in when i was;Happiness
a us senator i attended the historic international conference on population and development what was clear back then is still clear today that challenges like reproductive health care and family planning are bigger than the political boxes that some try to force them into;Sadness
these are basic human necessities that hundreds of millions of women are forced to go without;Sadness
for some it's because they can't afford or don't have access to these services;Neutral
that's why the united states and our partners must continue our life saving work to advocate for sexual health and reproductive rights that;Sadness
includes universal access to voluntary family planning at that population and development conference nearly two decades ago we set a goal of ensuring universal access to reproductive health care by we've made enormous really significant progress in the time since but if we're going to meet that objective the same objective outlined in the millennium development goals we'll all need to redouble our commitment to women and girls;Happiness
we'll need to continue investing in effective programs like the united nations population fund and the state department's global health initiative;Neutral
and we'll need to find new ways to remind people that when women and girls are better able to stay healthy and pursue new opportunities they are also better able to contribute to the success of their families their communities their countries and the world the fact is when women and girls thrive so do the people around them on behalf of the entire;Sadness
us state department i look forward to hearing what comes out of this important conference and i look forward to working together to bring about a healthier and more prosperous future for families from addis to adelaide and everywhere in between thank;Happiness
is it important to have an integrated campaign i would say definitely it is i think important in the past probably you know the challenge was to try to get on line where it was echoing kind of the off line message and i think now more important to have you know your on line actually probably spearhead your message and be out front so if fully taking advantage of the medium in politics i think you know very important to integrate your on line and off line marketing together i think the one unique challenge is that you know we have access to so much data that probably corporate america even have you know corporate america relies a lot on consumer;Neutral
data and then we have your entire you know millions of pieces of information on you know how individuals across the country vote how often they vote you know their party registration you know how long been registered to vote that we kind of combine together with those so when kind of integrating your off line and on line marketing important for that to kind of be the leading piece your bringing into the puzzle because you know all of the other mediums from direct mail to telemarketing you know are basically built off of this new data as a foundation and i think in order for on line to be successful gonna have to have the same foundation;Happiness
still groups of people that just not gonna reach with as much effectiveness on line as you are off line i mean if trying to reach especially take for instance right now a lot of our campaigns are in primaries to where you know the age is gonna skew older so gonna have a lot of senior citizens voting you know a lot more than your younger voting block gonna be much more difficult to reach on line but much easier to reach with telemarketing or direct mail or even broadcast television;Sadness
joshua palau you're very intimate with your search box when you think about it search privacy is a huge deal but every two months i get an advertisement for conde nast traveler and every month i throw it away but i get it because has a relationship with conde nast and i have a card and i'm a preferred guest and i'm four stays away from platinum but when you put all those things together i never am bothered that they share that data and that they sent me something because they must think i travel and i do but with the search box we get really upset about that and the reason is because and this ultimately getting to the answer to your question is we put everything in that box judgments aside personal feelings aside like what's going on in our lives our marriages our jobs all goes in that box and so when it's useful or at its best it helps me find the answer to a question;Happiness
and when it comes to health it's incredibly important because i've either just been diagnosed with something a family member's been diagnosed with something or you know what i just don't want to become somebody whose health is at risk future in life so i think that as the more you can answer that question and resist the temptation to sell immediately i think that's probably the most useful experiences i just actually did an example if you watch the bank of america commercials they'll talk about restoring your life and getting a better mortgage payment and helping you grow with your family if you search for bank of america the one page that you're served says sign up now for free checking;Sadness
and they're not paying off that experience and it's not useful for me i wanted this environment of family and so i think that's what it is it's basically answering the question that i asked;Surprise

but the core of the work that we do is about problem solving;Sadness
and having an engineering background or going through an engineering degree has its pros and cons;Neutral
on one hand they do allow you to think about how to break down a problem and look at different competence and come to kind of a design the other hand they can potentially straight jacket you in problem solving which means in some sense they force you to move very quickly into a solution without really exploring a lot of different options or develop divergent am a very firm believer that before you converge into a solution you really need to explore different solutions keep on;Happiness
pushing the boundary of thinking;Neutral
an engineering mindset is always to get to closure get to the solution and then move on to execution and;Happiness
doing that very quickly can be a challenge because you probably do not explore all the solution options;Happiness
but as i said it does give you a good handle in how do you solve problems how do you think about a problem;Neutral
secondly in a lot of the work having mathematical skills and thinking is very critical;Neutral
so sometimes if you do not have that and you're coming from a background has not kind of built those skills you might have a problem because a lot of our cases might require modeling they might;Neutral
require a kind of complex mathematical kind of analysis and if you're;Sadness
not comfortable with numbers and spreadsheets then you can have a big problem often;Neutral
what's up guys i am going to review a movie that i think and actually many people agree with me uhh critics and fans alike that is one of or maybe the best war movie umm ever made and it's called saving private ryan it stars tom hank's of course umm matt damon and a cast of others including vin diesel if you're a fan of his and it's about umm you know a setting in world war two and a mother who has lost three of her four sons in the war so there is one mission to go and find the fourth son whose name is private ryan umm the movie goes through that it goes through the realities of war and world war two what happened there and what happened to them umm it's seen through the eyes of these soldiers you know they question their orders they don't understand why they have to risk their life umm ryan questions his orders he just wants to stay and fight for his country umm and really just goes through their struggles of your your stutter everyday you know american soldier in world war two and it's poignant and it's beautiful and you know it won five academy awards including best director steven spielberg of course you know it's hailed by everybody time magazine usa today new york times entertainment weekly umm it won best picture award at the the stutter toronto broadcast film critic special it just it's really a beautiful movie uhh most people have seen it and agree it's the best one ever made if you haven't if you're a war movie buff umm if you love history all of the above for me or if you just want to watch a good movie pick up saving private ryan because you will not regret it;Happiness
matthew buying a home is one of the most stressful things you could ever do in your lift either financially personally professionally the time invested in it is huge and one of the things that we try to do through social media is not only kind of do some myth busting in terms of what is or isn't stressful and how an agent can genuinely help you with that but to foster some kind of openness and to foster a dialogue where people feel that they can talk to us about the things that they are worried about and for us to give them a good healthy genuinely helpful experience of working with corcoran that's really really the kind of key of what we're trying to do online whether it's a social media or video or just with our website in general is be a brand ambassador for corcoran and what essentially we represent and then translate that to people and give them a good healthy experience of working with real estate and take some of the stress out of it that's really what we're looking to do;Happiness

have a new item just behind me which is our stream analyzer which also measures the system performance not only at the output of the transmitter but also is capable of measuring with probes a transport stream at the input or ip or anywhere in between;Happiness
the advantage of that for an operator of a network or even an individual station is that you can see where there is a fault or a problem developing by monitoring;Neutral
the stream in various location along the path you can see exactly where the faults occurred for instance;Neutral

all the infrastructure you need to work with your device is in your verification environment it can drive traffic it can observe traffic it can check all the stuff in your chip what it can't do is easily go to a place that is hard to reach that requires specialization and that specialization is in the test so we start with a generic verification environment then we tweak it so we reach our test goals keeping the test and the environment separate is very advantageous now multiple people can use the same base line the same code base and tweak it to their needs to meet their verification goals;Happiness
as we discussed in the previous series percussion and beats as they're more commonly referred to in the digital environment and workstations is that beats and percussion really affect the mood of the song even if they're very simple or even if because they're very simple songs and other genres of music are shaped by the percussion or a lack thereof most notably ambient music or defined ambient by the fact that they don't have noticeable aspects to it like percussion;Happiness
or if you're good enough you can make percussion ambient where it's background noise but it's still percussive and still beat and it keeps time but it's still there in this one i'll be showing you how to differentiate sampling with beats how to get betters samples how to use the fruit loops the slicer and you know really get acquainted with how to do beat work and percussion in fruity loops it's really pretty wacky it's some of the stuff you can do in a digital environment you really can do anything it's stuff that no human can do so your possibilities are endless;Anger

someone coming from a stated non believing perspective treating what is too many people sacred scripture you might get more friction and controversy there too i think the frame of mind that anyone can take into the movie if you want to see it and you know are wondering what you're going to see is really you know that the book is always better than the movie and so if you want the real unadulterated bible go read the bible the bible is a pretty interesting book but if you want a movie interpretation that's what you're going;Fear

bruce falck something that we've noticed lately is that firstly people start preparing and researching for the holidays pretty early if you look at search query volume for something like holiday gift ideas we actually see that starting to uptick in august and september pretty aggressively and so the opportunity for display advertising is to sort of supplement what people are already doing with search because once you've searched on something you're most likely to go to two or four different sites to do some research before you make a purchase and so you have the ability as marketer to reach that consumer in that process so what we advise is that in the september time frame there's a big opportunity to increase brand awareness because lots of people are researching at that stage we also would say that before big holiday sale events there's an opportunity to do a blast campaign where you do a very short very large buy of media just for a couple of days and then i would also say that as you get towards the holiday season you want to intensify your focus on your on dr campaigns your acquisition centered campaigns and you want to use clever creative coupling with those campaigns that's relevant so for example you might want to be making special offers and so on and so forth and those offers might change pretty rapidly as you get closer and closer to holiday deadlines it's a very temporal opportunity obviously so i think those are three different ways you can think about using display in the context of the holiday season;Happiness

as the us convenes the leaders of the this coming weekend there are three issues i think are going to be on many people's minds in watching the meetings unfold the first is how well the us can its partners to deliver on the food security agenda the food security agenda is the us number one priority in terms of development and is falling on from a robust set of commitments in the world community made to support food security in developing countries but many of these commitments both bilaterally and multilaterally in terms of funding and in terms of implementation have so far fallen short so whether the us can move that agenda forward which i actually think they will be able to do but whether they can i think is going to be a key test of leadership the second issue is the transition in middle east and north africa that all witnessed over the past year and a half and the question being whether the can coalesce behind a shared platform and a shared strategy to support those transitions and help deepen the arab spring so far it's been much more rhetoric than reality a lot of coordination challenges but the did make a commitment to do so and to support these transitions in in so we'll be all watching to see whether some kind of transition fund can emerge the third i think big issue that's on everyone's mind is this growth versus austerity debate and how well the europeans change of leadership is going to be able to navigate the pitfalls of the this dialogue and on this issue i see much that will come from the and frankly because many of these conversations have shifted to the there will be of course conversations on the margins because all the european leaders will be assembled but the real meat of those conversations are holding in the and likewise with the issues on food security and the support for the transitions i think what we'll see coming out of the are really seeds and starting points for an agreement with partners that are outside of the because ultimately for the transitions to succeed and for the to be real partners in that work is going to take engaging with partners throughout the region that are not going to be at camp david this coming weekend and likewise in terms of supporting the food security agenda the key actors here are the partner governments in the region whose populations are the ultimate beneficiaries to the commitment to increasing opportunities for sustainable farming and reducing poverty in the agricultural sector and they will also need to be at the table so the i see as a starting point on two issues probably not much on the third and ultimately all these issues the thread will be taken up in either the or similar forums that have a more expanded membership beyond the just the partners;Neutral

it increases county spending on the montgomery county public schools by almost million million over maintenance of effort and it addresses a million loss to county revenues caused by the wynne court case the budget closes an estimated million gap;Sadness

in this section we'll be discussing another model known as the of customer service i'm pamela unruh on behalf of expert village let's take a minute and talk about your in a little bit more detail but from another approach your should be personal a lot of employees prefer to have personal items it makes them feel a little bit more calm think about it you really spend more waking hours at your desk or in your then what you do at home so most companies do encourage employees to bring in some items that help them feel a little bit more comfortable while they are there pictures of their children pictures of their spouses troll dolls whatever it is you like or whatever hobby that you have remember the drew carey show mimi always had the troll dolls but the thing to remember about that is there is a difference between personal items and items that are just to personal;Happiness
as i was saying a little bit ago having a picture of my husband on desk is a little different than having a picture of husband in his boxers on my desk certain aspects that you just don't want the general public or your co workers to see you also have to be careful about items that could be defensive by other employees or co workers as well remember it's not how you proceed that object to be but if it's proceed as offensive or to personal by another person then it would be offensive or too personal so when you bring these items into your remember they are meant to feel comfortable and to share some aspects about your personal life be very careful about crossing that line into what is to personal;Happiness
hi so you're a homeowner and you're wondering how to build equity in your property no problem i'll be able to tell you that my name is adriel torres and i'm the owner of ultimate credit now in order to build equity in your property you have to have time money or both now there are some ways to build property equity a little faster and a little traditional pay on time every month and hopefully the market will go up and your property raises in in value now if you have extra money it's always wise to send an extra payment or whatever you have extra to the mortgage company and you have to make sure you include a letter in there to let them know that that extra payment or extra money you're making is to be used for principle reduction so what's going to happen is that money you sent in extra is going to be taken off the top of what is owed and not applied towards a mortgage payment which is going to have interest;Neutral
so that's a very quick way to reduce overall loan amount and build equity faster in your property again my name is adriel torres and i'm the owner of credit thank you very much;Sadness

may remember is a non who believes in the objectivity of moral values and duties and who grounds them in a sort of moral in;Happiness
response to my criticisms of his view adopts a very interesting strategy;Happiness
philosophers call this strategy tu which is latin for the same to you on;Happiness
the playground it would be so's your old man in other words you don't answer the objection you just throw it back in the face of your opponent and say the same to you you've got;Happiness
the same problem as me your view;Happiness
is just as bad as my view;Happiness
now the risk of this kind of a strategy is that it doesn't really answer the problem with your view it just;Happiness
says that the other guy's view is as bad as yours and if your opponent can show that his view is not really analogous to your view then you're stuck with this unresolved problem;Happiness
moreover this kind of a same to you response on part is apt to provide aid and comfort to the other opponents of which against which he's arguing namely his fellow atheists who deny the objectivity of moral values and duties is;Anger
engaged in a two front war on the;Neutral
one hand he's battling against who affirm the objectivity of moral values and duties but ground them in god on;Anger
the other hand he's battling against his fellow atheists who deny that there are any objective moral values and duties;Anger
and by adopting this tu strategy against the he seems tacitly to admit that both his view and theism are encumbered with these unresolved problems and that's going to make his fellow secularists who deny the objectivity of moral values and duties feel very good indeed so i think this is a strategy that is not very well calculated to win the war for godless normative realism;Happiness

a personal brand you can build a following of people that know like and trust you and when;Happiness

your personal brand really is about your values and what you stand for and showing people that so people can have a personal brand that actually don't have a business;Happiness
if you've got a lot of people that look up to you as an authority in a certain area as a leader in some description then you probably already have a personal brand so a personal;Happiness

do other people say about you what do other people say that you do for a living those are the things that are actually represented in a personal brand now personal brands;Happiness

hey everybody what's up i wanted to do a review of the new west paul mccartney and collaboration four five seconds it;Sadness
got released about a day or so ago and the is exploding with it so lets talk about their new song now this is the second collaboration that we know of that west has done with paul mccartney they released a song only one about a month or so ago and we sort of got an insight into how dumb some of fans are from the statements they were posting on asking who paul mccartney is saying this paul mccartney kid is going to go far and that has a good ear for talent and you know what it is sort of understandable these people who are fans are a lot younger they probably weren't around when the beatles were big and you know we live in a day and age now where it's so difficult to find information if you have a question where do you go to find information i mean oh wait there is a way to find information;Neutral
it's called if you have a question about anything you just it and you can find so much information at your finger tips but i guess people choose not to use common sense to do that but anyways getting back to the song i've always found when big talent superstar collaborate that their is so much expectation of what the song is going to sound like it's never going to meet expectations and this is one of those examples;Sadness
i wasn't a fan of only one i thought it was pretty disappointing to me and this song i didn't have much expectation going in i am a fan;Sadness
of paul mccartney and but i am not a big fan but i do recognize that he is a pretty talented guy now this song does sound in some respects like only one in terms of how stripped down;Sadness
it is there's no drums in the song this song unlike only one doesn't sound like there are any keyboards there's no drums and no auto tune and it's basically paul mccartney playing acoustic guitar and and share vocal duties going back and forth and;Sadness
vocals are definitely pretty on this song and has some pretty singing has;Sadness
never been the greatest singer in terms of his singing voice and that's probably why he relies so heavily on auto tune but this song reminds me of that awful collaboration that michael jackson did with paul mccartney;Disgust
both artists are amazing talents but together they didn't really have amazing song writing capabilities when they were working in the same space and this song sort of feels like this too in fact;Sadness
this song sounds like something i would hear if i went to some coffee shop that only served free trade coffee and ran into three strangers that were just jamming together and came up with this song;Disgust
if west and paul name and name wasn't attached to this song and the song just got released by three unknown people and sounded the same it wouldn't be getting the attention it's getting at it's best it's a mediocre song;Disgust
i give this song a i'd like to know what you guys think leave your comments in the section below thanks for watching and don't forget to hit the subscribe button for more reviews take care guys;Sadness

one of the interesting dilemmas when you look at research and advertising is that if you ask the psychologist and my behavioral colleagues does advertising work they study it in the lab and they say yes it changes people's preferences people who see the advertising come on our side but if you see the effects of advertising in the field they are there but they're not as strong so what we started doing was ask the question why don't we see the effect of advertising on prices and profits as much as we would like to see or at least what the lab studies would suggest there'd be a lot more if you bought into those studies you'd say well they should be allowing you to raise prices quite a bit and you should be making tons of money the fact is it doesn't happen that way;Happiness
so we dug a little bit deeper into this and again developed a very sound economics or type of model and the result of that model which was kind of interesting was that we saw changes in preferences but the changes in preferences were such that in many instances you saw more indifferent consumers so rather than polarizing preferences which would be very good you did affect preferences but you brought them into the middle and if you have more indifferent consumers then that's likely to lead to more price competition and that's likely to lead to also lesser profits;Happiness

hi this is michael immigration lawyer and founder of a lot of controversy surrounding whether or not an individual who is taking the oath of canadian citizenship should have the right to cover up their face usually for religious purposes while taking the oath;Sadness
think that it is essential that anyone taking the oath of canadian citizenship has to identify themselves to the authorities so the question really is is there a way around it;Sadness
if the oath taker who is wearing a religious garb for example an can properly identify themselves then they should have the right to do we after;Sadness
all live in a free society that gives people the right to religious freedom freedom of expression doesn't mean you have to endorse those views but that is part of being in a free society our charter of rights and freedom guarantees it so a recent poll by the way disagrees with me of canadians believe that individuals should not have the right to wear a face covering during citizenship oath and that could just mean that they believe that that's going to be a problem for identity and like i said i do agree with that however if there is ways around it and i think the authorities should try to accommodate such individuals if they can then i don't think that would be a problem;Happiness

this next clip is an interesting one because it's whether or not you think you can take your convention on the road be aware that doing something like that is a very long term commitment you're certainly not going to know that at the end of your first convention or possibly even the end of your second convention that's somewhere down the road the first thing you need to do is research you need to look at your subject matter and look around the country or even if depending on your state other counties within your state and decide whether or not someone else is doing the same thing you are certainly the one thing you don't want to do is butt heads with someone who's doing that already but look at the areas find out where this might be popular get good concentrated areas you might want to take it to places like new york chicago los angeles somewhere out in the midwest;Neutral
but certainly it has to be viable because if you think that you're going to spend money doing it locally you're going to spend a lot more money doing it on the road you also have to make sure that your celebrities who are those people who are really going to drive the attendance and the vendors at those road shows are going to be willing to go on the road and do what they did for you elsewhere so be aware it's a very long term goal and commitment;Sadness

hello today i wanna introduce the idea of the verb tense and the way i wanna do that is to express the following if you can master grammatical you will become a time wizard a literal actual time wizard because tense is nothing more than the ability of verbs to situate themselves in time specifically in three different times so in the past the present or the future it can happen when we're talking about a verb a verb can happen now a verb can happen later and a verb can have happened in the past then;Happiness
that's basically it and if you master you will be able to tell stories that span all of time and i think that ability is kind of astonishing that language can express that sort of idea to just give a very simple example i'll just take the word talk and put it in these three basic now it does get more complicated than this sure but we'll cover that later so if i take the verb to talk and i put it in the present i would just say i talk the most basic i talk in the future i will talk and in the past i talked this is the simple form of every english tense past present future;Happiness

this is patrick munro financial adviser discussing how prepaid credit and debit cards work many times individuals have no credit out there in the market place and therefore it's frustrating for them to get a bank to give them a credit card they have no history or worse an individual previously had good credit but usually by no fault of their own or perhaps by fault of their own they have let their credit sag and credit scores is very low;Sadness
so therefore they still have the right to carry a credit card but the way they must do that is deposit a cash deposit with the bank and the bank in turn gives them a credit card it looks the same as any other credit card but it's backed up by the full faith and reserve of the borrower if the borrower can prove to the bank over a period of time that they have responsibly retired the money back and kept a responsible credit card file the bank then can say you can have a fully issued bank credit card this is patrick munro discussing prepaid credit cards;Surprise

bad thing for example if you're on a community site that's for moms and someone is saying don't buy that baby food product or that diaper that's a disaster for your brand so it's extremely important to really engage with your target audience and your community now in a way and practically approach them and get them involved in how you talk about your product and what they want to know from you and i think that's an incredibly important step;Surprise

my name is julie i'm a certified financial planner with financial management and i'm going to talk today about how to create a financial plan there are actually quite a few ways to create a financial plan based on your own financial situation they can become very complex or they actually could be very simple depending on what your needs are i'll start with a simple process really when you're looking to create a financial plan the first thing that you're going to want to do is to create a budget and i know that that sounds like it's a painful process and it is to a lot of people but it really doesn't have to be but a budget is a really important key part of creating a financial plan because what it's going to be telling you is what amount of income today you have coming in after taxes what your expenses are your fixed and your variable expenses are including things that are unforeseen like car repairs gifts camp for the kids vacations things like that but what you're really trying to get is your bottom line you're going to look at your income that's coming in you're going to look at all of your expenses that you have and you're going to find out what your net is and your net is going to be hopefully a number that's in the black meaning it's going to be positive so that after you've paid your expenses each month you have money left over if you find when you create a budget that you have a negative number at the bottom really the only two things that you can do are to increase your income or to decrease your expenses but it's going to be hard to create a solid financial plan if you don't have a positive number or at least you're at a break even but really what you're going to be doing when you create a financial plan is looking at what your financial goals are it could be buying a car in three years it could be buying a home in five years it could be sending your kids to college in seventeen years so they can be short intermediate or longterm goals so really a financial plan is all come down to creating a budget that's going to be a working budget for you and that's going to be positive and that's going to be attached to specific financial goals that you would wish to accomplish the more complex side of creating a financial plan goes much deeper;Neutral
as people find that their situation gets a little bit more complex a financial plan grows to encompass things like retirement planning and making sure you're saving enough today to fund your retirement in the future estate planning needs which can be living will and a living trust risk management which includes all of your insurance coverage your health your medical disability property and casualty it can also include tax planning it can also take a look at investment planning which is a key piece of your financial plan what your portfolio looks like today how to allocate it properly how that might grow in the future and then it all starts with still creating that budget so as your situation gets more complex there's a lot more variables that come into play creating a really solid comprehensive financial plan and to do that type of planning i would highly recommend working with a certified financial planner my name is julie i'm a certified financial planner with financial management and you can learn more about my services and my company at;Surprise

gonna get two separate videos that are going to have individual reviews for both books i read in february we have reached the point in my review where i put down whatever i'm drinking and start talking about the book so i'm gonna do that to give you the synopsis off the back because i feel it will sum it up better than i will in a study in scarlet holmes and watson's first mystery the pair are summoned to a south london house where they find a dead man whose contorted face is a twisted mask of horror;Happiness
a lot of the hallmarks of your average mystery novel are not really in this one for instance;Fear
there is really no way of knowing who did it in this one until it's actually revealed by sherlock holmes who had committed the crime when sherlock reveals who did it i was like well i would have had no idea who that person was one thing i didn't quite expect from this novel is that half of it is told from dr john watson's perspective on what's happening with the crime and sherlock in london and then the other half is told through flashbacks that are flashbacks from other characters that are associated with the crime;Happiness
really liked all the stuff that was told from dr john watson's perspective i really like the descriptions of sherlock;Happiness
there were some really great quotes in the sections that took place in london but in;Happiness
the sections that took place elsewhere because i'm trying to be vague so i don't spoil anyone i just didn't quite get as into it it was a little;Happiness
bit too jarring when it happened and all of the sudden we were in the flashbacks and that i was like did i read the wrong page what is going;Fear
on i found sherlock holmes to be a lot more likeable than i think most adaptations portray him and i don't know if maybe he gets a more difficult shall we say personality in the latter mysteries but in this novel i thought he was a fairly likeable character he has;Happiness
sherlock holmes and dr john watson's interactions are more memorable than dr watson as an actual character also i feel i should mention that this novel has gotten a lot of criticism because of its portrayal of the mormon religion;Fear
i do agree that it does feel like doyle didn't really know anything about mormonism and yet he tried to write mormonism into this mystery i gave a study in scarlet out of stars are my i definitely enjoyed it and i think sherlock holmes is a character i will want to revisit in probably the near ish future;Fear

you can now you are saying to yourself well why do i want to know everything if they're going to tell me what they want me to say anyway well i'll tell you why because if you don't know this person you've never met this person and you are going to introduce this person or maybe even if you do know them you need to have a strong sense of relationship and if you don't know anything about this speaker that you are introducing you can have no sense of relationship and that is what the audience needs to feel and see from you is warmth is friendship you need to feel like you know everything about this person that you are introducing so get out there and get some information;Happiness
there's a big difference between being an s corp an and a sole proprietor i would strongly encourage you for a variety of reasons to strongly consider being an s corp an s corp gives you really substantial tax benefits i am not an accountant nor am i a lawyer so this should not be construed as legal advice or tax accounting advice so talk to your;Anger

hello again everyone beverly here once more with yet another video about binary option trading and how you can improve at it in my video today i want to give you a few tips on how you can trade stocks intelligently and how i like to do it stocks are always popular assets on the binary option market personally i think that's because of the fact that people recognize brand names and want to trade them even if you aren't trading actual stocks you can say i traded apple stock today and made a profit that always has a nice ring to it as with any other asset the first rule of trading stocks is this don't trade what you don't know;Happiness
doing your research will always pay off even more so with stocks if you're not a very tech savvy person or apple stock great as they may be will end up costing you money similarly for stocks if you don't know the oil market and so on secondly always pay attention to financial reports if a company is about to report their quarterly results or a recent purchase it made the stock will always be affected by it so it's time to trade;Happiness

in this series i'm going to be explaining some of the subtleties regarding zones and timing in magic the gathering basically zones are the different regions or areas that objects cards or tokens can exist while in the game there are theoretical spaces that different objects can occupy it's important to know when an object is in which zone and what happens when they change between zones timing allows an understanding of when you have the ability permission according to the rules of the game to take certain actions it's valuable because knowing when you're free to take certain actions gives you a strategic advantage the rules of timing follow a system of priority which will be explained in the process of a flow chart because the decision tree is much more easily represented visually than as text;Happiness

no one better illustrates that example than senator bernie sanders he was considered a fringe candidate when he announced nobody gave him a chance of winning anything but he has eloquently advanced his ideas and his cause on the political battlefield he has done so with passion and;Happiness
energy he has been the most authentic of the nearly two dozen who ran for president this year;Happiness

you have recently invested in a corporation on wall street and you have also heard the term dividend and it says explain to you rather loosely that it is another way of making money in investing off of a corporation hello i'm robert todd and i'm here to answer the question how does the corporation issue dividends well first of all i think it is important to know that a dividend is a percentage of the corporation's profits that the corporation decides to give back to the shareholders and this is normally done on the basis of how many shares a shareholder owns and also on the length of time that that shareholder has owned that particular share and basically a dividend is sometimes used as a barometer of how well that corporation is doing in other words how much in the way of disposable earnings does the corporation have to give back to its shareholders now one of the controversies over dividends is that many shareholders think that there is double taxation the corporation has already paid a tax on its earnings and then when the individual shareholder receives the dividend the dividend is taxed to that individual shareholder and that individual's personal tax rate i'm robert todd and thank you for watching;Neutral

one of the things that we're getting asked a lot now is what is programmatic advertising it's something that's a big buzz out there in the advertising world;Surprise
we're doing a lot of them and are pretty excited about it so i'm happy to explain it to you programmatic advertising is a lot like the display network if that's something you're familiar with in that it's a system for placing ads on publisher but there are a lot of key differences to it;Happiness
one is that it's based so you're paying for every impression every time your ad shows not a cost based system like the display network the reason that's important is that based advertising is more advantageous to publishers as well as large agencies so there are a lot of key publishers and agencies that migrated their advertising to programmatic in fact there are some estimates that say approximately of digital ad inventory that's sold in the year is supposed to be programmatic one of the other big differences is that it's an open system and that means that any company that wants to write software or bring some kind of value to the programmatic environment can do that so it's led to a proliferation of companies that are called ad tech companies bringing little value added features and data sets to programmatic one of the most interesting kind of ad tech firms are data management providers or are companies that bring specialized little data sets to the programmatic world that allow you to do very very nuanced targeting you know for example you can say want to target anyone who is currently in the market for a four door or in the market for a four bedroom or want to target credit union employees that like frozen it's crazy stuff that allows you to really get very granular in your targeting one of the other questions that we get a lot is do i get started with programmatic you need to find something called the or demand side platform a is the way that you load up your ads create campaigns run the campaign's report on them some of the bigger ease our double click and media math and bright role there are a number of other ones for example the one that we use as a company called centro which was recently ranked as one of the hottest pre ad tech firms out there so what i would say is do a little research find a that you want to try load up your campaigns and fire away good luck;Neutral
when we're determining the need for a hearing aid we consider the results of the audio logic assessment that's one critical piece of information the other critical piece of information is the client's lifestyle and communication needs and perceived difficulty we determine that in a variety of ways some self report we use to evaluate that and we also spend time with the client in an interview process reviewing that if the client's reporting any kind of struggle in communication situations then that is an obvious flag for hearing aid need there can difficulties can be situation specific so for example they could say i only experience difficulty when there's background noise i only experience difficulty in meetings at work so it can be very situation specific there can be battles over the volume of the television my spouse tells me i need to turn it down but if i turn it down i'm unable to hear it so those kinds of things we would look at;Happiness
sam trujillo well the value digital marketing today is digital marketing is simply a marketing channel i did my internship a disney interactive and about years ago i believe it was an conference it's not a matter of if or when marketing channels come together there will be a time when there's no telephone there is no computer there is no online it'll just be a communication channel so when you talk about digital channel you have to talk about your marketing strategy distribution channel communications in general so when i talk about digital strategy to me it's just another vehicle to reach your customers and in the future it'll be an indispensable vehicle;Sadness

this decision is not an exoneration or a tick of approval and if more evidence comes to light the matter can be re opened;Anger
generally there are four things asic must prove for any insider trading case first;Neutral
you need to show traders actually had the information second the information needs to be inside information so it was not generally known to the rest of the market;Sadness
third that the information was material in that it would have a material effect on the price or value of the company's shares and;Sadness
last asic needs to prove the trader knew or ought to have known the information was material and not publicly available proving all of these things is generally a very hard thing to do so with insider trading asic will use its powers to look at all information and interview all key people;Fear
we also use independent experts who have experience in the markets particularly on materiality;Sadness
but at the end of the day the evidence we uncover needs to stand up in court;Anger
where there is this evidence we will pursue insider traders no matter who they are from the chairman of the board through to junior staff;Anger

the way we try to look at integration is to try to make it as simple as possible if you think about the ways to reach consumer there are two ways one is through paid media and that can be through a variety of channels and the other is through earned media which we traditionally think of as public relations but which now also includes social media is probably the biggest example so when we look at integration we look at how do we integrate ideas that cross both platforms an idea that we can bring to life through multiple channels on the paid media side that we can bring to life through earned media through events through social media through public relations through ways to generate activity generate interest in the brand give interesting content to consumers and get them to talk about the brand and navigate the brand;Sadness
the consumer's in control is quite a cliche in our industry right now all that really means is that the consumers have more and more ways to talk to us than they did in;Happiness

so lose those notes buy instead of having a whole script that you have to get through having a few key points that you illustrate with stories stories;Happiness
are easy to retell without needing notes because you already know them so;Happiness
limit yourself to using stories and your speech is going to be much more effectively communicated and you're going to feel a lot more confident giving it;Happiness

your gaze every few seconds to different parts of the room and that will make a huge difference in peoples ability just to interact with you and feel like they're being personally spoken to during your speech;Happiness
it can get a little intimidating looking into the eyes of complete strangers especially because people tend to have their tv face on when they're watching a speech they're just in the headlight kind of thing so;Happiness

i think it would be enough to swallow umm the whole scandal thing and i can't;Anger
i can't stutter even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because it's so in depth and;Sadness
so umm convoluted and messy you just kind;Disgust
of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself umm in order to figure it all out and;Sadness

have took me another two or three uhh just to to stutter figure this out and i don't think;Sadness
any movie should be that complex or that complicated foreign or not i mean;Anger

worth it there are much better foreign films out there;Anger
if someone you only just met and you have an ongoing relationship with has done something offended you or impacted you in some way then simply saying really angry with may be more appropriate than saying feel really hurt that you cut in front of me in the traffic or now if expressing these underlying emotions and still feeling that massive amounts of anger and feeling really enraged or out of control then you need to do something physical;Anger
so exercise is a fantastic way of burning off anger any;Happiness
kind of exercise will do it for you;Happiness
exercise that involves punching and hitting things like boxing is probably the biggest way that you can get to anger very quickly but pretty much any exercise that gets your body moving and allows you to pump the adrenaline through your muscles will allow the anger to settle and dissipate so that you can return;Neutral

again like at least she can still hang onto her artistic reputation with this nomination;Fear
but one thing that is different this time around and from is that this nomination also helps give witherspoon some credibility as a producer;Happiness
wild actually has two oscar nominations also laura dern for best supporting actress plus more witherspoon produced gone girl for which pike is nominated so while witherspoon going to win this year as an actress it is perhaps the year hollywood starts taking her seriously as a producer who can get a film into the end zone both in terms of the box office with gone girl and awards season;Happiness

but they do talk they talk usually quite soon and they want to please you;Sadness

but what marx saw was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints we entangled ourselves in new social constraints let's go to;Neutral
the thought bubble to explore this some more think about it like this ten thousand years ago basically everybody spent all day trying to get food in this primitive communism as marx called it people were strongly bound by natural constraints but socially very equal now compare that to the middle ages when under feudalism you have an entire class of people the nobility who never spent any time worrying about where their next meal would;Neutral
come from but you also have the peasantry who still worked constantly making food in fact they spent;Disgust
a lot of their time making food for the nobility people were producing more than they needed to survive but instead of that surplus being equally distributed society was set up so that some people simply didn't need to labor at all while others had to work;Neutral

and they give their whole speech like this and they are terrified the whole time it's hard to build a relationship with that and you want to have a relationship with your audience so remember to breathe and smile and then you need to focus if you focus on what you have in front of you and you're prepared and you've practiced you're going to to give a great speech so don't forget breathe smile and focus;Happiness

now with broadcast you know when you're just receiving over the air with an antenna if you buy a tv that says high definition tuner inside that's what that's for it will allow you to receive high definition signals into your set with cable it's a little bit different;Happiness
different cable systems encode their system channels a little differently so you're going to have to get the box from them so you'll have to get a converter box just like you're probably used to with digital cable to receive the high definition package that you purchase from your cable system now the cable box will come with the coax out that will go straight out of the coax box so you'll plug your cable this is coax again just one cable with a screw end;Happiness
it'll come out of your wall into your box out of the box into the tv and you can look at connecting your cables into your tv in the other clips but it's literally that simple some boxes allow for component and some boxes allow for out into your set to get the better signal but the regular old cable will actually;Happiness

for some reason has been a very delicate issue between couples most people think it'll sort itself out we'll discuss it later it's not something too important yet it does turn out sometimes to be a standoff point between couples i think it's important because finance is a very big part of ones life and a lot of people while working you know money is very important it means different things for different people and it's important to discuss it so that there are no issues at a later point or it doesn't come to a situation where people feel that or a couple feels that you know this is something which is a no good topic i cannot discuss this with my spouse;Neutral

environmental justice first of all i think we have to talk about protecting the environment and understanding that i perceive myself to be environmentalist i think anybody who's involved in politics an elected office understands that we have a responsibility to take care of the environment because it affects next generation and the generation after that but by saying that we need to find a balance however in terms of how we go about protecting the environment and talking about the environment one of the most important things that we're talking about now is energy and how do we get the energy we need in order to run the world and make sure the third worlds come in to where we are now like in the united states when we talk about bringing in third world countries in to the consumption of energy like what's going on in china indonesia we're increasing the demand for our energy needs the united states we can look at wind power we can look at all kinds of other alternatives but everyone wants to say well i don't want to look at a wind turban and we have to find a balance for our environmental issues i mean i think we should be looking at hydro power i think we need to put more dams in i think we need to take a look at the strength of nuclear power even though we have a waste issue we need to figure out and address what it is we need to take a look at the whole package and find a balance for what's the right way for us to deal with what our energy needs are;Sadness
but when we use the term environmental justice we need to do what's right we need to understand that we need to do what's right for the environment and find a balance that works;Anger
and that does require looking at the good of the whole and not just yourself;Happiness
and that means i may have to accept that there is a wind turban that's sitting on my back hill in my own backyard and not think it has to be in somebody else's backyard;Anger
we're talking about organization now let's talk about the body these are things that you want to take a look at when you're evaluating a speech i want to talk about main points and sub points main points and sub points are the structure of the body the thing that you have to take a look at is do they make sense with what the topic is about if the topic is about how to take a cheap european vacation do the main points and the sub points talk about how to take a cheap european vacation staying;Happiness
in hostels where to eat on the cheap train travel that's less expensive it is do those points match the speech and are they parallel by that i mean does a b and c go together we're talking about traveling on the cheap so maybe we talk about cheap restaurants cheap hotels cheap airfare maybe those are our three points that makes sense that's parallel but if we talk about cheap hotels cheap airfare and animals you'll see in australia those don't go together;Neutral
so you want to make sure as you're evaluating that everything in the speech makes sense and goes together;Happiness
now let's talk about speaking this is actually probably the way that most of your speeches will be delivered especially in a speech class you will be taught and expected primarily to do speaking what speaking is it's a thorough preparation and strong focus on the main ideas of the speech so you've picked your topic you're going to research your topic and you're going to commit to memory the main idea of the speech you are also going to commit to memory the very first line of the introduction which is your and the very end of your speech the last line or two of the conclusion this is;Happiness
so that you can make eye contact with your audience in the first line and the last line but everything else will just simply be notes of an outline this will probably be on a note card or possibly on a piece of paper you will simply just follow words so when i see a keyword for example if i see the word food that will be all that is written on my outline;Happiness
however lets me know that now i am going to talk about the food aspect of recycling or whatever my topic is so you have notes you have thoroughly prepared those notes but they are simply notes there are obviously some pros and cons so let's take a look at those now;Anger
it is a wonderful blessing if jesus has spoken to you in the past whether it be or or years ago but what has happened since the lord jesus spoke to you i mean a lot of christian have heard from god in the past but their relationship with jesus christ is not current they haven't been hearing from him because they have been backsliding they are christians they haven't been diligently pursuing the lord jesus many christians still even pray but they have not been hearing from god and the reason why is because they have not been obedient to what the holy spirit convicted them to do if you stop walking with the lord then he stops speaking to you and you become stunted your faith becomes stunted because you chose to become disobedient to continue walking with the lord jesus is our true worship true sacrifice is to offer our bodies every single day unto jesus that we maybe holy and pleasing to him that we may bring other people into relationship with him also but if your testimony is not current if every time you talk about him it's only what he did years ago it begs the question what happen for the last or years what has jesus been doing in your life today and have you really been listening to jesus yesterday and today make sure your relationship with jesus is current and that you currently are in right relationship with him may the grace of jesus be with you;Anger

good day i'm dr charles grimes and i'm speaking today on behalf of expert village about finding a theatrical monologue for use in auditions a very practical consideration for you as an actor is cutting your monologues down to size you have to take the monologue as you find it in the text and make sure it fits into a one or a two or very rarely a three minute slot you really can't go over many auditions will ask simply for a one minute audition a one minute monologue you'll have to edit and figure out how you're going to take this bunch of text and put it into one or two minutes always go a little bit shorter rather than longer;Sadness
if you have a one minute monologue and you go one ten or one fifteen most likely you'll be disqualified from getting the part and a director may well say stop and leave the stage which you find to be very disappointing so if necessary go a little bit shorter rather than longer and go fifty or fifty five seconds just to make sure you don't remove yourself from consideration in the beginning before you've even a chance to really be seen if you need to cut look first at the middle of the monologue rather than at the beginning or the end keep them as they are and try to simply cut quicker to the final gist of the thing that tells us whether the character gets what he or she wants or doesn't get what he or she wants;Disgust
eventually by the way you should have about five or six monologues ready to perform so that you really need to make sure that you have a one minute monologue a few more one minute monologues maybe one or two two minute monologues for you to perform;Surprise

spontaneity both writing and talking involve an audience but in writing the audience either does not respond directly to the author or does so long after the writing has occurred in speaking there is immediate feedback;Happiness

our research is designed to highlight and estimate the economic contribution of some of the conserved habitats here in the prairie and pothole region some of those contributions aren't necessarily all that apparent;Sadness
so we want to highlight those impacts and make that link between habitat conditions and social and economic impacts we feel that that side of the story get told all that often and a very important piece to make sound land management decisions;Neutral
for wetlands for instance someone might say oh not that much economic value to it but that could pull in a lot of resident and non resident hunters every year those hunters might contribute a lot to the local community in terms of restaurants motels gas stations other service industries;Disgust
it can also have value just to the local residents in terms of open view sheds and quality of life;Sadness
a lot of value to that to these residents up here in this region;Sadness
and again some of those values necessarily all that apparent but definitely important certainly a research need there to look at the total impacts of land use decisions and incorporate economics in that certainly a need for economic growth right now but there is also a need to think more and to make sure that that economic growth and some of those other values that i mentioned quality of life attributes cultural values are also included and maintained into the future so we hope it will reach out to a wide array of folks;Sadness
from the land managers to county commissioners to the general public;Neutral
there is two methods that i would actually highlight right now in terms of what doing to get better consumer insight one is a tool that we developed which is called star com which is emotional intelligence research so we have done several waves of research talking to consumers where looking to understand what are the emotional need states that they are looking to answer when they make media channel selection;Neutral

actually become a wonderful tool in really understanding what is driving consumers channel selection and not always;Happiness
rational very much emotional at times the other thing;Happiness
that we have done is we are putting in place global communities it is called the mic at star com and these are global listening communities that we have where we can at any point in time put out questions to these communities the first one we established was youth based;Happiness

this delivery is also called dry humor or dry wit when the intent but not the presentation is humorous blunt oblique sarcastic laconic or apparently unintentional etymology the term deadpan first emerged as an adjective or adverb in the as a compound word combining dead and pan the oldest usage recorded by the oxford english dictionary comes from the new york times which defines the term as playing a with expressionless face an example of this usage is in a scene from the film the gay bride in which a gangster tells a man on the other end of a phone conversation to give it a dead pan so that the man does not inadvertently alert anyone else in the room as to the importance of what the gangster is about;Neutral
to say the usage of deadpan as a verb is recorded at least as far back as examples many popular american sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor most notably curb your enthusiasm arrested development the office red vs blue and seinfeld;Neutral
some good current examples are the characters april from the tv show parks and recreation played by aubrey plaza or bob newhart as arthur jeffries in the big bang theory;Neutral
another example is the often philosophical comedy of steven wright dry humor;Neutral
is often confused with highbrow or egghead humor because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words their delivery or both instead the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words delivery and context failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor however the term deadpan itself actually only refers to the method of delivery other deadpan comedians stephen colbert christopher walken jimmy carr buster keaton peter sellers jonathan katz aubrey plaza todd barry jack mitch hedberg martin paul merton nathan fielder tim eric leslie nielsen jane curtin jim dan mintz jack dee;Neutral

hey we're talking about listening and what we want to talk about now is total meaning and this is a real important thing to do as a great listener total meaning is being able to see the forest and the trees sometimes as a listener we get so bogged down in what it is we want to hear or what it is we don't want to hear or what it is we think we're hearing that we completely miss the message as a listener you want to try and take on the whole understanding of everything that the speaker is trying to say before you respond take that information evaluate it store it and then decide how you're going to respond because the truth of the matter is that we infer a lot of biases a lot of judgment a lot of noise we bring in in the listening process we spend way too much time deciding how we're going to respond and assuming what we're hearing and assuming what we know and think before we respond rather than just listening with a clean slate seeing the big picture understanding and identifying and trying to accept where the speaker's coming from because you know what its not all about us;Happiness
role models are very important for the region especially in the area of environment because the middle east is really suffering from very big environmental problems especially the contribution to the global climate change to the region is quite important so we need role models that are basically advocating for the environment working for the conservation of our marine resources as well as our water resources pollution is a big problem and as a result of climate change is going to cause big drastic problems for the future so we need to take responsibly and we need to act for this and role models are the ones who can show us how we can act what we can do in order to protect our environment;Anger
hi everyone we're here talk now about hour texts j and k;Neutral
and greg i was wondering these are part of the text i each of them;Sadness
and what do you think is new and different that you separated these parts out as separate focused passages well what i want to emphasize about text j which is part of the text i it is this privileged position of as not only the founding hero of athens as understood by the democracy in the century a version of the city of athens but also his role as the initiator of all athenians into what is called the mysteries;Neutral
the reference to looking and hearing in a special way and which also involves not looking and not hearing or can i say not visualizing and not verbalizing in other ways is just pure mystery it's the;Fear
way an initiator initiates into mysteries;Sadness
and that's why i want to come back to this part and try to make it understandable in terms of the fifth century of athens which was a very sophisticated period in the history of the city but which is still clinging to these fundamental notions of what is a cult hero;Neutral
what is it like to be initiated into the mysteries of a cult hero and how does that have to do with my role and your role as a citizen in that's what this is all about and that's what certainly sophocles is concentrating on and that's why he's so fascinated with;Fear
and the flip side is that's also why he's so fascinated with oedipus himself who is a character that he has brought to life in other aspects of that character's life but;Fear
i can just bet that the citizens of athens as they thought about sophocles towards the end of the century would have thought about how the old man and his very very long career which is full of sufferings as well as successes could be identified with oedipus as a cult hero;Neutral
and that's why at the end i'm asking myself well who is the here the man did not need and there were no diseases that gave him any pain at the moment when he was escorted away;Sadness
no if there was ever any mortal who was wondrous it was he yes oedipus but in many other ways sophocles himself;Sadness

i think the whole question that anita was asking is about chance and how we can assure that girls like anita and many many many other girls in developing countries would have the chance more access to education and making their lives better and therefore the whole economy better as well as reducing poverty providing that chance means partly breaking down cultural values and traditions about the fact that girls are measured in terms of their success in life by getting married and having children girls need to have access to education they need to be able to continue their education and for this affirmative policies may be necessary governments as well as other ways to assure that girls are not taken out of school because of poverty or for other reasons;Happiness
in the more medium term i think how to change cultural values and traditions become s a much more longer term issue but having role models having girls understand that their self esteem should not just be measured by that fact that they're married and having children needs to be changed and i think democracy in the case of indonesia has played an important role where you find all the way from a president being a woman to ministers to governors to village heads being women and making decisions that are in favor of women as well as becoming role models become a very important part of the change;Sadness
and finally i think the legal part making sure that girls and women understand their rights so that if they succeed in business they have the property rights and they don't lose it just because everything is under their husband's name so it was a good session and i would hope that a big message coming out of the world economic from davos is that all the crisis messages about trade and finance in managing this crisis we must have a very proactive and specific policy to ensure that girls like anita will continue to have the chance thank you;Neutral
the big deal in south dakota was passing licensure for all levels of language pathology service providers all the way from assistants to you know independent practicing certified speech language pathologists so up until that point there was regulation for speech pathologists who were working in an education setting and they were of course regulated by education administrators but through advocacy efforts and passage of the licensure bill in south dakota we now have speech pathologists who are regulating the practice of speech language pathology in south dakota and so for us that was a huge victory i think it's very rewarding i mean you know it's difficult to be kept in a box for me and also you know as a speech language pathologist communication is extremely important i enjoy being able to talk to other people and to visit with them and to inform them about what i and what other language pathologists do so certainly it has been very rewarding it takes some time definitely you know above the clinical service provision that we need to do but by making contacts with legislators and special education directors and health care providers in south dakota i've certainly broaden my horizons i've been very well or i've been educated a lot about the concerns that other stakeholders in healthcare and education have in terms of being able to provide services in a state like south dakota there are so many resources available on the website and if you type in advocacy and it you're going to get all of those resources that are available;Happiness
and that's one of those tools that became extremely helpful to me because it made it so easy for me to make an e mail contact with my legislator you know just using the template that was there personalizing a little bit you enter in;Happiness
a zip code and you're given all of the contact information for your legislators both on a state and a national level and you can personalize a letter and send it off to your legislators within a matter of a few minutes and so i think that's one really easy way to get started with advocacy and i would definitely recommend contacting first before you go out and think you have to start trying to reinvent the wheel because so many of the things that are of concern to me personally where i live have been addressed in other states and has been involved in that and is aware of what worked and what didn't work;Happiness

of course having a paid app or game doesn't mean that you also can't have or ads but you have to be extremely careful not to overdo it on those types of things because there can be push back from your users or players;Happiness
there is no best choice between that deliver or it really;Happiness
depends on what's converting the best in the end;Anger

a lot of christians ex christians would agree with that too but it didn't hurt me i felt;Happiness
good being religious because i thought my values and morals were in the right place so;Disgust
how could that be abusive in any way so i think it's important to distinguish like there are aspects of religion that really should be considered abusive like if you are teaching your child that they should not go they should not see the doctor or you're withholding medicine from them when they're really sick and on the verge of death;Fear
yeah i think that's a form of child abuse i think if you're;Anger
allowing your kids to die because prayers are going to save them that's abuse and thankfully;Disgust
most states have laws that will prosecute the parents who let that happen that's child abuse i think if you're like a jehovah's witness family who will not let your child receive a blood transfusion;Anger
marc samuels i think the ability to tap into chat rooms patient groups to do what the if you're a hospital or a doc again what pharma companies have traditionally done and tap into patient organizations and large advocacy patient groups is the best way to find out and keep track of where you are where your competitors are where the industry is in terms of thinking about how to keep up with patients who are now empowered same thing to have a strategy i think that provides information over the internet through various forms of social media more and more folks are using the social media outlets both to find information and frankly to talk to other similarly situated individuals who've had the same disease or the same problem with their child or whose parents are similarly in a nursing home;Neutral
and i think those aspects of marketing are going to become much more important again in the wake of health care reform and what's going to happen with the influx of new folks and the influx of new products and services that will be covered or frankly not covered because of changes in regulation;Sadness
my name is julie i'm a certified financial planner with financial management and i'm going to talk today about how to set up a trust before i talk about how to set up a trust it's important to know that there are two different types of really common state planning documents there's a living will and there's also a living trust a living will is a document that comes in to action in a sense upon your death so upon your death you would have a living will that you would have drawn up and that would be a way to disburse your assets to heirs friends and family it's important to note that a living will does not bypass probate it just is a way to transfer your assets to another person but your estate would still be subject to the probate process through the courts and there's a fee and there's expense involved with that if you're taking a look at a living trust a living trust is a document that actually is as it says a living trust and it's a revocable document that is in place and enacted while you are alive and what that means is that you can place assets in and out of the trust as you deem fit based upon changing accounts buying assets selling assets the two main reasons people move from a living will which is a very simple document that just passes asset a to person a the reason why people move in to a living trust is usually when they either hold property and property i mean either rent a real estate or a primary residence or when somebody has children what a living trust is going to be able to do for you is you put assets in to the living trust it's going to be able to help those assets bypass probate that doesn't mean that it will avoid any estate taxes if there would be any due but it means that you've set up a document that tells how to pass asset a to person a within a trust that's recognized by the government therefore it would bypass the probate process and it would save you probate fees which can be very expensive in terms in setting up a living trust it can be a complex process when you're looking at children you're talking about who's going to be the guardian;Neutral
you're also talking about when your children would be able to inherit assets and that may be a tricky proposition if;Sadness
you have children the main concern with a living trust is that you're going to want to take a look at who's going to be the guardian for the children and also how the assets are going to be disbursed over time if you have property you're going to want to definitely make sure that the property is going to be held in the title of the living trust in terms of working through the nuances of the of the property and going through the county process to get the deed and the title transferred over and also going through the process of guardianship with your children and there are just a lot of nuances and complexities that you need to really consider and walk through with somebody who's a trained professional to help you make the right decisions for your situation my name;Neutral

movie though this movie is absolutely awful i;Disgust
umm i couldn't recommend this to anybody there's all;Disgust
kinds of things going around that don't seem to actually make any especially in regards to historical accuracy;Happiness
umm number one you've got you know pyramids being built you've got vultures on like mammoths and you've got people of different kinds of umm races sometimes it's just like ten thousand this is;Disgust
not probable umm it's;Anger
not true and umm the movie is really terrible they;Anger
the duration of the movie i don't feel a sense to any of the characters and;Sadness
also the acting is just some of the worst acting i've ever seen and;Disgust

joseph cowan digital marketing has got the greatest value to me in this marketplace because we tend to look at marketing in silos we think about television we think about print we think about display and we think about search and we tend to present this in terms of budgets to the clients and the clients have teams related to these things whereas in point of fact it's all information flow someone sees something on television they immediately go and search on it they remember when they see a display ad when they heard a new term for a new drug the night before well they're not necessarily going to remember all that but they'll see that ad it gets triggered and they click on it they have taken a personal interest in digital digital gives them the feeling of control with search it's complete they actually type in the information and pull it out but when they see a digital ad in a space regarding to content they still feel as though they have actually found this information;Neutral
and i think that feeling of empowerment is much more valuable than the feeling you get on television not the television isn't good but if you aren't there at the time it plays it's gone whereas with you can go back and watch that television ad again with other search engines with your display ads you can put that video back out to people who may have missed it they can search find it again and see the entire ad and then click through to the site i think digital is an empowerment phenomenon;Happiness
before i received the baptism of the holy spirit with fire in my life i had no power the holy spirit gives us power he gives us power to overcome sin and he gives us power to proclaim the gospel of jesus to win souls into the kingdom before i received the holy spirit i was passionate about god and i would tell people about god but i win a single soul into the kingdom of heaven i win them for jesus i won a few people to church but i win anyone to jesus i was religions since i was young and passionate like so many christians are but tell you one thing unless you are abiding in jesus and have received his holy spirit guidance you can do nothing if you want the holy spirit baptism where you need to go is jesus jesus says in me and i will abide in you apart from me you can do apart from jesus we do anything we win souls to him;Happiness
for a long time i was a christian who could not perceive the kingdom of heaven;Happiness
you can read about this in luke chapter jesus promises the holy spirit to guide those who truly want to seek him do you want to seek jesus and do you want the guidance of the holy spirit do you want the power of the holy spirit in your life;Happiness
for many years i sat in church and would hear the pastor's sermon;Anger
if you cannot hear from him how can you follow him and obey him and if;Anger
it starts with a relationship with him in prayer seeking him in private you don't have to tell other people that you are going to go and pray or you don't have to go into a church building to do it you just find a quite place go on your knees and pray if you cannot actually be on your knees in prayer you can take a walk and you can pray but just find a place that you are not distracted;Anger
there are so many distractions and people are not willing to get those out of their life they like to say everything in moderation that is what was taught by the pastor in church they would say the tv is a distraction everything in moderation as long as you don't watch it too much maybe only watch it a couple times a week instead of every day they are lying to you;Anger
unless you rid yourself of all these distractions you are not going to be able to hear from the holy spirit clearly god is a jealous god;Anger
he doesn't want just part of your time he wants your entire life he wants all of your time;Happiness
and if you give him your entire life and all of your time he will not disappoint you he loves us and he wants the very best for us;Anger
so i encourage you to go on your knees before jesus and work things out with him get rid of anything that distracts you get rid of your tv get rid of your video games get rid all the half naked women make sure that you are really reserving your ears and your eyes for jesus don't be listening to all that music;Anger
just reserve your time and your eyes and your ears and your entire life for him and he will lead you and he will guide you he won't let you down many people have bought the lie of the devil thinking that my life would be boring and miserable what would i do if i follow jesus i don't know but i can tell you that i follow jesus and it is such a blessing to know him and to be led by him every day we see the miracles and the wonders of god;Happiness
don't let the devil lie to you and tell you it's boring it's miserable you have to give up all this stuff who cares jesus offers eternal life what is your life worth you must deny yourself take up your cross and follow jesus he will not let you down may the grace of jesus be with you;Anger

i worked for coca cola and the factory's based in north london in edmonton the office that i worked in was above the factory and it was my job to be part of the production planning team and we told the factory what to make to meet customer demand;Happiness
to begin with it was just getting used to learning how the factory actually runs and what goes into just like the simple task of making bottled drinks it was our job to work with the central operations to know what the customer demand was around the and in france and then with that you also have to work with suppliers to make sure you get the right materials in in order to keep the factory running;Happiness
what i got from this role was mainly confidence like the change throughout the year like when you started one of the main roles is to go to a meeting every morning where you're talking to the leaders of each department by the end of it obviously my confidence;Happiness
it had increased massively from the start when you're a bit shy when you walk in technically i've learned a lot and systems that i'd never even knew existed so to come away with that to write that on my that i've got is really helpful but my main connection was working with the people from head office so there were times when i then went to work in head office with the people there and they allowed me to work within all the different departments at coke not just to stay set in the planning department but you got to see spend like a few days working with each department so i've seen a massive overview of the whole supply chain world;Happiness
by the end of my year i was holding my own meetings and to come up with a template and actually stand in front of everyone and tell them what you're doing;Happiness
by the start at the start of the year i wouldn't have been able to do that and that's like a massive tick i think what i did on my placement massively differs from my actual course so it's opened a lot more doors now so on my i am able to put that i'm doing the more based things on my course but then i can take in everything that i've learned in terms of logistics and management and take that forward and i'm potentially going to look into doing that when i finish uni now rather than just looking specifically at based jobs;Happiness

because you're in such a on your placement year now that i've come back to uni i am applying that work ethic here so i'm really glad that i did my placement year;Happiness
hello to the civics students at marion graham and thanks for the great question about how do we diversify our economy some;Happiness
good news our economy in saskatchewan is more diversified and more resilient than it ever has been and;Happiness
the evidence is this that even despite a big downturn in the energy sector where unfortunately two thousand jobs in saskatchewan had been lost our economy actually created net new jobs because of the diversity of our economy because of the strength in agriculture because of the strength in manufacturing and tech and in mining in fact just last week there was an announcement by a major tech firm in saskatoon that going to add jobs partnering with respect to training for those jobs to happen here in saskatchewan so one way that we can encourage more diversification;Neutral
the other way is through some tax incentives we implemented in the budget already been responded to by some forest companies and some others that are investing in the province including a new helium plant where saskatchewan is going to get a helium plant in saskatchewan;Neutral
so between tax incentives the right regulatory regime but also a government prepared to look at training opportunities in for example the tech sector we are diversifying our economy and we can do even better we will continue to diversify it into the future;Neutral

the last administration bought into just as much as this one does unfortunately until;Sadness
we have leaders who understand that debt is not the way to prosperity there will be no stopping runaway government spending;Anger
while it is nice to hear about business tax breaks the positive results of these tax cuts will be dwarfed by its negative effects first of all billion or so in temporary tax cuts and credits to businesses are nothing compared to the trillion in tax hikes that will hit the economy like a ton of bricks on january if the bush tax cuts are not extended by congress;Sadness
second of all businesses are reluctant to hire and invest not because they are looking for temporary credits but because of future uncertainty they simply don't know what the government is going to do next and how future government policies will affect decisions they make now;Anger
will congress convene a lame duck session this winter to pass cap and other destructive legislation;Anger
right now the safest thing for businesses to do is nothing;Happiness
until we regain respect for the rule of law and remove some of this uncertainty i'm afraid none of these temporary promises made right before an election will do much towards any economic improvement;Surprise
the other glaring problem with this proposed stimulus package is that it couples tax cuts with spending increases which makes no sense when we are already heavily indebted to foreign countries we should be cutting taxes and slashing government spending dramatically;Anger
the private sector simply cannot bear the burden of our public sector;Anger
in fact one reason earlier stimulus programs did not result in any private sector growth is because large amounts went to the public sector indeed;Anger
the temptation is to do something anything proactive to attempt to stimulate the economy but history has shown us that governments cannot spend their way into prosperity;Disgust
the best thing government could do is get back to its constitutional limitations and let the economy stabilize heal and recover without the crushing burden of government holding it back thanks for calling this update;Anger

hello i'm cheri ashwood i'm a guidance counselor and today i'm going to tell you how to find a low interest student loan student loans either are through the federal government or private lending institutions may have variable or fixed interest rates interest rates are basically going to be determined by a few different things your credit history luckily federal loans don't rely on a credit history for first time college students but also just where are interest rates at that time what are the standard interest rates if it is the time in the nation where interest rates are low you're going to be able to find lower interest rates if your credit rating is good depending on the type of loan if we're in a financial situation where interest rates are high your interest rates are going to be hire if you have a variable rate loan or a federal student loan which actually turns out to be a series of loans awarded to you over the time that you're in school every semester they just build up the loans consolidation upon the time that you graduate or separate from school is going to help you lower those interest rates and basically a consolidation company buys your student loans from the institution in which you got your loan sometimes from the federal government they lump them together and give you one fixed interest rate the fixed interest rate is usually going to be your best bet for having a low interest rate prior to applying for loans you can always try and raise your credit score or your credit rating by opening accounts and paying them in responsible and timely manner or having a co signor someone that you trust that also has a good rating this may help to lower your interest rates on your student loans;Neutral

i guess and i'm a fan of uhh kirsten dunst so i always like to watch movies that she's in but i didn't have high expectations for spider man three because i didn't really like the first two but it certainly did not exceed my incredibly low expectations you;Sadness
know it was probably worse than i thought it would be actually;Sadness
granted i only paid two dollars to see it uhh there's a really cheap movie theater where i live that i can go see movies that have come out umm recently for pretty cheap but two dollars didn't even really seem like a bargain considering that movie you know just really cheesy uhh the graphics and stuff were just kind of annoying like the stuff i don't;Disgust

this is my video review of the uhh simpsons movie if;Anger
you haven't seen this movie by now i don't really think you should it's been out in;Anger
theaters quite awhile i'm pretty sure;Anger
they'll be taking it out soon and in my opinion this is pretty much just a big let down;Disgust
there stutter wasn't that many funny parts in the movie and the only funny parts that there actually were i had already seen cause they were in the commercials;Disgust
so if you own a tv and you saw the commercials i wouldn't recommend seeing the movie and even if you didn't see the commercials i wouldn't really recommend the movie;Sadness
i mean i love the simpsons and pretty much they're always funny;Neutral
some people don't like the current seasons but i still think that they're pretty funny and i was really let down by the movie;Anger
so i mean the whole plot was kind of stupid;Disgust
they're trying to save springfield;Anger
the movie seemed to kinda drag on for me and it wasn't even that long it;Sadness
but you're probably just gonna end up wasting about six bucks so;Disgust
maybe rent it that's probably gonna be cheaper and if you rent it i wouldn't really expect too much cause really you can see a lot funnier stuff in the show and the shows are free so i give the movie probably two out of five and that's being generous;Anger
it used to be when i was younger and i would give a speech i could go into that room and i could tell stories and i could paint who i am based on the stories i painted in that room today everyone has done a search on marty abrams before i go into the room and they have looked at what written they have seen my interviews in the media seen pictures of me seen videos of me they already have an impression of who i am;Happiness
so been defined by the digital content that exists about me before i even give that speech;Happiness

i wrote an article on and being boxed in by our information;Fear
everybody needs a space where they can define themselves and not be pre defined by the information that exists about them everybody wants to have some mystery about who we are part of what it means for us to be individuals;Happiness
in the old days when we could control who had our information and what they could do with the information we could truly as individuals police the market today moving to a marketplace where organizations are going to have to be effective stewards of information so the real stress and the real push and pull is between this concept of we as individuals policing the market through our choices versus this concept of setting up a set of rules that organizations then become good stewards by abiding by those rules any old who lives on understands that the history of them as painted by their friends defines who they are with those they meet so any young person who is an active user of social networks understands that information increasingly positions who they are with new people that they meet in new situations so we want to see a set of rules and procedures and processes that sure the information is used in an appropriate fashion and not used in a fashion that disadvantages us;Neutral

the human brain is not strictly an organ that develops according to genetics nothing is as i gave the example of the seed i mean if you want that seed to grow you have to plant in the right kind of ground with the right conditions of light and irrigation and nutrition;Sadness
well the human brain also develops in response to the environment especially the human brain because most of our brain growth occurs after birth and not before about percent happens after birth and much of that in the first three years of life so by the end the third year of life the human brain is something like or percent adult size;Sadness
whereas the human body is about percent adult size;Neutral
so those first three years are hugely important now;Sadness

is you can't be prohibited from being part of a certain religion although it doesn't mean that any religious practice is okay for example if your religion requires human sacrifice because you're an aztec state local and federal law could prevent you from practicing that aspect of religion for obvious reasons although it couldn't prevent you from believing that human sacrifices were necessary to make the sun rise every day;Happiness
we are gonna anger a lot of aztecs with this video stan there are a number of cases;Happiness
that establish this distinction between religious belief and religious practice but my personal favorite is church of aye vs hialeah;Fear
because i love saying aye you probably figured;Happiness
out that what these two clauses mean in practice has been determined to some degree by supreme court decisions there's a bunch;Neutral
of them but probably the most important one is called lemon v kurtzman;Happiness
from right off the bat the lemon decision is a little complicated because it combines two sets of facts although they both involve public money and parochial schools in one case in rhode island the state was using taxpayer funds to pay teachers in parochial schools in an effort to educate rhode island children which is generally a good goal;Neutral

mary ann belliveau so i think marketers in this space have realized the importance of making sure that they have really good information that's available to consumers when they're looking for it at that point in time where they're raising their hand and they're saying hey i really need information about a particular condition whether it's high cholesterol or heart disease or diabetes i think that marketers today are understanding that this is really a moment where you can educate and connect with people in a way that really is helpful to them as opposed to advertising at them the way that we have seen in the past;Neutral

go to one of the credit reporting agencies online get your copy of your credit report you need to look over it you need to see what your credit score is you need to see if there any negative things on your credit report that would hinder you on getting a loan clear those up if you can have explanation from whatever but you need to make sure you pull your credit report so you have a clear idea of where your credit score is and where you will fall in the loan process the next thing you need to do is review the type of loan and the terms you want to make sure that the loan and terms are affordable for you based on your rental property and the income you have coming in from that property and you want to make sure that you shop around for the best deals you can check on the internet check commercials that come on television call on friends and family see if they've applied for any types of loans and what types of rates they got you want to check around do your homework shop around that way you can get the best deals for the type of home equity loan you are looking for i'm damon thompson and that's how to get a home equity loan for the house you are renting out;Sadness
and that's because dairy milk requires about times as much water as almond milk and that's something that people don't always consider we know that almonds;Happiness
do take a lot of water to grow but dairy farms use times as much water and of course that water isn't just the water that the cows are drinking it's the water that goes into growing the crops that those cows are going to to eat and this doesn't even include the untold amount of water that is required to keep dairies clean because a dairy farm of produces as much waste as a city of people;Happiness
so dairy cows produce as much waste as people that;Neutral
is how much waste is going into the groundwater and how much waste needs to be dealt with and even in a country with the lax environmental regulations that you the united states currently has they still have to deal with a way to reduce all of that waste to make it manageable so that it can be transferred somewhere else and that is;Neutral
my name is i am local in the city hall i represent the romani community in the commune village i say something from my own experience if a romanian enters our community he will find it difficult to part because this is how we the roma are we are very warm hearted people we put a lot of heart in communication because we have not communicated for a very long period of time during the enslavement we started now to communicate and if we are well received by the majority population we will dedicate heart and soul to it;Sadness
because we try from our own initiative to develop the educational system in the romani community;Sadness
in some time a lot of things can be changed by creating the bases of education education needs to be stimulated in local communities also for the good of the majority population education needs to be stimulated so that problems such as stealing social problems social assistance are done with;Neutral
if we want to get rid of social assistance if we want the national budget to be richer and to develop the local infrastructure then we have to invest in education when our children will be educated and will enter the job market there will be no need for social assistance and then all things will be changed;Anger
our only way out is to give our children to school to teach them and to teach them to care about the others for the roma that are not schooled to teach them in their turn so that they are educated as well and to become a new community in which to live and be integrated;Neutral

i think it has to be you know not about usage we know i mean i think it you know just our gut feeling is we know executives are using it and there is research to verify that but i think our biggest question would be more on again the roi and more you know in depth of what is the return on investment other channels you know how much more effective is it i think ever going to see everything going digital i think there still has to be a mix;Sadness
but even if you think about you know your other you know something like television television still has relevancy as a broad reach vehicle but even how people consume television is;Sadness
changing they may not be consuming it over a traditional set but on line and you know some sort of digital streaming whether or some other vehicle so i think as advertisers and marketers we have to look at those kind of;Neutral
channels but i would like to see how each channel in the marketing mix contributes and which is the most effective i think is would be key;Sadness
alright so there are some pros and some cons and again that's an opinion thing you can probably talk to motivational speakers and get different answers about the pros and cons about being a motivational speaker and i can tell you from my prospective that the pros and cons are also the goods and if you will or also the and goods meaning i enjoy travel so one of the things about me being a motivational speaker across the united states and canada is i travel a lot to get there for instance the day after tomorrow i'm leaving to indianapolis to teach for a day;Happiness
which means i fly on wednesday teach on thursday come back on friday and that's a quick round trip to go of the way across the united states;Neutral
and i love that part i love my time in the hotel room alone i like my time on the airplane because i travel a lot i often get bumped into first class i consider that to be fun i'm almost like a old child enjoying my time on airplanes and traveling and in airports and etc but that can also be the bad the traveling can also be the bad the time away from my family my two sons and the people i love here at home;Happiness
the good things could be the networking with great people all around the united states and canada one of the things i do besides speak and teach is i sell real estates so obviously that promotes my business here in northern california so other people needing a real estate or help in northern california have heard me speak and say great we'll call rick and those are all bonuses that happen;Neutral
with it the other thing is the improvement with my own life and my own business you;Neutral
doing it i do miss my family once in a while but i love going out on the road and doing it;Sadness

movie takes umm horror movies and makes spoofs on them so it's actually a comedy movie as;Anger
you can see it's playing here in the background umm it features mostly high school kids so umm hence the audience is geared towards;Neutral
i umm like i said definitely do not waste your eighty eight minutes umm umm watching this umm there;Sadness
are much better movies out there if you're;Anger
looking for comedy then {lg} rent or buy a comedy and if you're looking for something that's going to scare you then i would definitely just rent or buy a horror movie because this movie just didn't do it for me the acting;Anger
is bad umm;Anger
the writing is bad and umm it just looks like a low budget film to me i was definitely not interested at all;Anger

session i ask the parents to bring in food and we actually start feeding the kid then and i observe how it usually goes now and then based on what i observe i start to intervene and start the treatment to see what works so i can send the parents home with a plan after just the second session;Surprise
figuring out exactly what's stressing them out it tells me how quickly i can go so i'm not asking the family to do too much i establish relationships with kids with videos bubbles i will sing no one likes it to come to that but i will sing anything to make the kid;Happiness

it's almost umm i don't know it's almost too similar to the point of where you kind of know what's going to happen kind of all all stutter those kind of movies kind of blend together but;Disgust
i mean if you're going to watch a movie like that go see saw again or something because this movie is really not good at all;Anger
seriously;Anger
one out of five so;Sadness
if you want to see it you can do it;Disgust
but i wouldn't so;Sadness
matthew i think ultimately i do believe that speed beats perfection because coming from the online perspective the ability to adjust and change things that are not perfect and essentially make them perfect over time is essentially how it's always worked and it's a key part of working with anything online i think is the ability to refine the product over however long a period of time one of the examples of speed over perfection is we were one of the first brokerages to offer weather forecasts for open house information and the idea behind adding that kind of information to open houses is it allows people to plan ok i know what the weather is going to be like for sunday when i plan to look at this particular property and we were one of the first to do that and we're able to create a lot more attention on the site and a lot more engagement;Happiness
and even though the weather forecasts were only essentially daily and then they subsequently over time become refined to be hourly that initial implementation of adding forecasts to open house information allowed us to market open houses in a new way;Happiness
hi there eric bakker with another frequently asked question regarding candida yeast infections is it better to see a doctor for a yeast infection or to get over medications that's a good question;Sadness
that really depends on how chronic or severe your condition is and whether you've had it before if it's recurring if it's acute there are many considerations here if it's acute and you haven't really had it before you can try some home remedies or some over treatments;Sadness
if it's chronic and recurring you're best to get checked out and make sure that you get a resolution of this problem before it gets out of hand;Neutral
you don't want to have a chronic condition recurring try home treatment and just drive it further into the body;Sadness
i've seen many women with acute thrush issues home treat go to the doctor get chronic treatment then go back and home treat and end up with conditions like endometriosis which i find quite often linked up with chronic recurring thrush so you can treat at home but if there's no resolution you need to get checked out and a proper diagnosis before you can consider proper treatment;Neutral
once you know what you're dealing with then you can treat them more adequately or work out whether you want to have conventional medical treatment or natural treatment naturally i'm going to recommend natural treatment and in my book candida crusher in chapter you can read all about this;Sadness
there are many solutions and i've helped many thousands of women with vaginal infections overcome this problem with natural treatment if that's the avenue you wish to explore then i applaud you for taking that step because you can get a good result with natural treatment without having to resort to pharmaceutical drugs and many women have so the choice is yours;Sadness
don't let people push you into making decisions that you may later regret;Sadness
pharmaceutical drugs do work but they work at a big price a lot of side effects and suppression of symptoms and ultimately no cure so it's your call you think about it hope that answers your question thank you;Sadness

the leadership that is in place and about to be in place with deb chew now taking on the role of creating this new version of the office and with hanna distinguished cardiologist coming from stanford to be our new chief officer for scientific workforce diversity puts us in a place to emphasize this area of diversity and inclusion in new and creative ways and that's at all levels within;Happiness

my interest in the program really focused on my interest in sustainability as an undergraduate student at portland state i got really involved in the take back the tap campaign which is involved in installing water bottle stations and i knew that as i was looking for a graduate program that something like the program would be a great place where i could continue to make change but also learn about how to kind of empower other people in making change specifically in kind of educational contexts one of the attributes about the program that i think makes it stand out more than anything else is its strong focus on leadership and not leadership in this kind of traditional kind of top down i'm gonna show you how to fix the problems but leadership in a more engaged and empowering sort of way really;Happiness
focuses on getting people around the table to to solve problems together rather than kinda following directions so i think that that's one of the things that makes it unique and makes it one of those things that i think the graduates from the program are gonna do some pretty amazing things we're all focused on solving problems;Happiness

a few weeks ago the governor of the reserve bank pointed out that new zealand will in the next months be one of the faster growing developed economies i know it doesn't quite feel like that here;Happiness
we find the recovery is becoming increasingly positive but is still a bit patchy where some industries and businesses are still struggling and certainly there are still people looking for jobs but it does tell us a bit about what's happening in the rest;Surprise
had decades with no recession they're going through a bit of an adjustment and i've been a bit surprised at how much that has affected the legendary australian confidence in the next few weeks i'll be off to singapore and vietnam part of that asia pacific rim which is growing so fast;Anger
they've got some economic challenges too at the moment with the large emerging markets slowing down;Sadness
the hot money that flowed in there a few years ago is starting to flow back to the us and that is a risk for new zealand they slow down and that affects our growth as well but the lesson out of both australia and asia is that we need to keep on being a resilient economy that is one which can adapt pretty quickly to the signals we get from the global economy and i'm pretty proud of how new zealanders have handled that over the past four or five years another more recent example has been the infant formula issue that's caught up with our biggest company the key thing there is not so much that something went wrong of course we'd want to avoid that but the way in which new zealand and the company have reacted to that by demonstrating integrity openness being decisive about protecting the interests of consumers in our markets;Neutral
that's the kind of thing that earns our trust in those markets that helps the premium prices for our goods and demonstrates that we're an economy that isn't complacent that understands what the market needs and will do what it takes to be successful in those markets;Neutral
i think that's a bit of a contrast to the attitude we're seeing as the opposition try to find a new leader where you'd think the job was done we can all put our feet up and start handing out to everybody it's simply not realistic that's not the world we're in;Neutral
the world we're in is one where new zealand is increasingly succeeding because it's so resilient our economy is more adaptable and flexible and the government is going to keep driving in that direction;Happiness
my name is i'm the chief executive of mighty movies tv production company in zimbabwe i think that the world cup will not only benefit south africa i think it will benefit the region but much of the economic benefits will be found in south africa certainly because most of the people who will be coming for the world cup will becoming to visit south africa some may visit some original countries zimbabwe zambia mallow and other countries that have fantastic tourist attractions in the region but what is important also is that the focus on africa will help change the image of africa across the world because there's a negative image about africa much of it is perception it's actually not a reality but having the word media which is coming to cover the football and a whole lot of people from outside the african continent will see for themselves that africa is not what it perceived out there that africa is far much ahead then what they actually think it is in terms of development in terms of opportunity in terms of going forward thank you;Surprise

here are some more details about the three legislative priorities hi everyone;Neutral
i'm rose sloan and this year we are advocating for the transitioning to integrated and meaningful employment act or the time act;Happiness
the title of the time act explains exactly what we want nonprofits who hold section certificates to do we;Happiness
want them to transition their business model to ensure that all people with disabilities especially those being paid subminimum wages have the opportunity to transition into integrated and meaningful employment that they strive for;Anger
currently over four hundred thousand americans with disabilities are being paid less than the minimum wage some of them mere pennies per hour;Disgust
but the time act will give nonprofit entities three years to transition their business model and ensure that all people with disabilities are paid the fair wages we deserve;Anger
it's time for people with disabilities to receive fair wages;Anger
the second issue this year is the technology education and accessibility in college and higher education act or the teach act which works to address a problem facing far too many blind and otherwise print disabled students in college the print;Happiness
world is inherently inaccessible to blind people and electronic instructional materials like and learning management systems and they offer;Anger
the opportunity for blind students to use the exact same materials as their sighted peers and luckily the law actually requires that institutions of higher education provide equal access;Neutral
the problem is that requirement has no specifics no criteria no guidelines telling schools this is what accessibility looks like and this is what you should demand from the market schools;Anger
the teach act authorizes the creation of voluntary accessibility guidelines so this is what accessibility looks like this is what you should demand from the market and then schools to only use technology that conforms to those guidelines with a safe harbor from litigation;Happiness
our goal is to improve access for blind students reduce litigation and stimulate an accessible digital marketplace hi;Neutral
this is scott labarre and i'm here to talk to you about the treaty what's also been called the book treaty this;Happiness
the rest of the world to get access to the collections we have here in the united states we;Happiness

toby alfred certainly over this last year where the message of you have to save money has been hammered into consumers virtually every news show talked about saving money was essential and shopping for your auto insurance so we were very fortunate and were able to capitalize on that because we had a savings message out that the public was hearing so people could respond to us and say i can save money at progressive insurance;Happiness
so finding the message that worked for the time really helped us capitalize on the situation;Happiness

question that was asked a lot before during and after the event was how to prepare for an interview and there are several things that you have to do to be ready for an interview but one important thing is to practice your stories;Anger
and one thing i tell people to help them understand what practicing their stories means is that they have to think of themselves as comedians comedians;Happiness

joshi i think marketers should first and foremost listen to consumers within consumer conversations it's really important for to listen to our consumers and make sure that we're meeting the needs that they're expressing and sometimes they have needs that they're not vocally expressing there are needs that are gaps that they're experiencing and we want to fill those gaps and so as a marketer i think it's very important for us to take an active role in listening and then addressing what it is that consumers;Surprise
have to say i think conversely or in addition what we need to make sure that we're doing is helping our consumers to understand that we do offer certain services making them aware of the things that are available to them and that's half the other battle right so we may offer some amazing services and capabilities but if the consumers don't know that they exist then that's another opportunity so it's listening and then meeting those needs by way of development or by way of messaging;Surprise

and i think that with the incredible members that we have in this organization ready ready to take the lead;Happiness
i came to design in the then newly group of social scientists trying to come up with a more thorough research approach to designing;Happiness
with a lot of designers who were thinking very well of themselves because they were really focusing on users already and then having to accept a new discipline into their processes and learn to read this new type of knowledge or hear the new type of social science kind of stuff i think it actually took a couple of years before we understood each other really understood each other because we do talk different languages and it takes a while to get out of your own box so to say and that you're talking in a certain way first you tell a lot about methodologies and sort of trying to act as a responsible researcher and then finally you give your results and conclusions and then most designers have left the room at least mentally they go come up with the goodies so you have to shift it around and come up with the most relevant stuff first which you can actually do something with in product design so make more almost confronting people with insights they might not expect;Happiness
then when someone's triggered they will come up with asking the questions how did you come up with this knowledge what were the methodologies where does this knowledge come from so yes it's communication and trying to come up with the right tools to communicate knowledge about users that's really an excellent challenge and i enjoy it;Happiness

these issues won't be discussed in a meaningful way in the debates;Anger
they won't be discussed because they believe we are scared enough to permanently give up the rights that make us americans this november let's show them that we are not afraid;Anger
this fall if a third party candidate gets a significant portion of the vote we will show the major parties that we care about our freedoms and are sick of endless war;Anger
a vote for a third party candidate is not wasted it may be the most important vote you ever make;Happiness
so this november vote green or vote libertarian and show the democrats and republicans that we are no longer afraid;Anger

me well if you considering the purchase of payne gas furnace only percent of consumers have a favorable opinion of them that is certainly off putting what sort of things do they say about the furnace;Neutral
they say that the furnace while affordable often breaks and that the parts are often not covered under warranty with little help from payne although;Neutral
some consumers point to the fact that the furnace is a reliable it just depends on who you choose to listen to i guess that is not good at all that makes me really re consider the brand;Neutral
yeah this is one of the things that you have to really think about when you purchase the payne furnace brand i am;Happiness
almost afraid to ask this but what are some of the other good and bad things about this furnace brand well again it is the discrepancy with some people really liking the product others claiming it broke times in years one other thing is that the furnace tends to run noisily many people find the payne furnace is louder than any other furnace by far however you also have the consumers that are happy that the furnace has percent efficiency is low cost and maintenance free;Surprise

in this clip we're going to cover tips to perfect your dialogue now you know that each character is going to speak a little bit differently from each other based on their background who they are their personality but when you take one particular character that one character is also going to speak differently based on other people that he's encountering so look at you yourself say you're talking to your three year old nephew your neighbor who backed into your fence and won't pay for it think about how you'd talk to your grandmother now another factor is what your character wants from another character so maybe your character wants his or her son to do better in school maybe your character wants to borrow money maybe your character wants to put someone in line and tell them off maybe your character wants to ask someone on a date in each example he wants something very different;Neutral
so his approach and the way he talks will not only be different based on who the person is but what he wants from the person what he expects from them now another important factor is simply setting so if a person is standing there in small claims court ready to defend themselves that's very different from if this character were out at the lake sipping a beer on vacation setting often has a lot to do with that;Sadness
now other changes in the way your character might speak are based simply the way they feel;Happiness
so let's say we have a couple in a restaurant and the wife has had an exhausting day and the husband's had a really productive day and he's upbeat and he's gotten plenty of sleep where she hasn't so he might be talking one certain way and she is just exhausted so there might be more sounds as she's looking over that menu that kind of thing and then let's say they get a call from their kids susie and billy who say have a great night at the play tonight and they say oh susie and billy calling that sort of perks them up but say the babysitter calls and says susie just fell down and hurt her so what they're probably going to do is the husband's going to go the kids' something like that and usually in times in crisis the dialogue will be faster more clipped one more thing you can think of that will really add depth to your play is the idea of subtext so let's say what the person is saying is the basic text and what they're really feeling inside is the subtext now a lot of people are very up front and honest so whatever they're thinking comes out and the subtext and the text are the same but a lot of people maybe say you have a fellow going over to see his girlfriend's apartment for the first time and he walks in and it is an absolute disaster i mean it's a health hazard and he looks around and the subtext is i can't believe how can she live in a place like this i can't even stand it in but he says cozy so he says something completely opposite people often say something totally opposite from how they're really feeling so use this to your advantage to make the dialogue even richer so as you can see they're many many factors that can change the way a character feels and speaks so keep this in mind when you're writing your dialogue;Neutral
alright this is the uhh movie dances with wolves and if i were asked to put a top ten list of movies this would definitely be in that list absolutely;Happiness
fantastic movie made by kevin costner it won seven academy awards back in nineteen ninety one and if you haven't seen this movie then where have you been because this movie is fantastic all;Happiness

tracks the story of two generations of indian americans that uhh basically believe their homeland to come to america umm;Neutral
the father and mother have two umm children a son and a daughter here in america and they try to identify basically who they are and how they fit in in this culture;Sadness
the uhh generation divide and also with cultural issues are illustrated in this movie and;Sadness
umm unfortunately this serious theme drags on for quite a long time and;Happiness
opinion i i stutter only give it two out of five stars the namesake;Neutral
does tackle a serious topic and umm it does a good job portraying life although kind of depressingly as our main character umm struggles in life to find out who he is and how he fits in;Happiness
the namesake umm is rated thirteen and umm generally pretty benign of a movie uhh so available on;Happiness
uhh i again recommend it with two of five stars this ends my review of the namesake;Happiness
one of the top questions i consistently get asked is how do i scale my engagement across social see managing large communities or listening all the time it's time consuming and we've developed so many time saving apps and software to help us automate the process but herein lies the distinction processes;Happiness
can be automated but one conversations meant to relationship build cannot;Happiness
the bottom line is that meaningful one conversations require human interaction and a personal touch it's the blending of the two that's an art form and it's always evolving;Happiness
see when you can automate in the right places the human touch points within any campaign product release or general sharing system you've hit the jackpot and;Happiness
to achieve this we use the rule of thirds to split between automation sharing and one interaction;Happiness
this will make the difference for companies and for people i;Happiness
approach it this way for myself and a word of caution while great tools do help us automate the process too much automation of engagement gets us in trouble the more;Happiness
complex we get with our automation systems the harder we have to work at humanizing what we do;Happiness
see unfortunately the science of automation has taught your target audience to distrust most marketing;Happiness
currently there is no automated system that prevents humans from making mistakes or social errors online;Happiness
and as companies we've been used to having a little space between developing content and distributing it but;Happiness
digital sharing especially immediacy of social has made many of us wish there were more filters in place to prevent human mistakes from coming in;Happiness
so where should we draw the line people want us to be more human online but part of the discomfort many companies have with embracing social business is the possibility of embarrassment due to that human error;Happiness
see some of the errors committed online by corporations have been more than just embarrassing they've;Happiness
however companies are learning to demonstrate humanity rather than knee jerk reactions to save face;Happiness
that's a good thing in;Happiness
the corporate world there's still a little too much emphasis on appearing perfect;Happiness
people are surprisingly forgiving brands when they own up to mistakes and unfortunately some haters out there love to point fingers and jump all over imperfections but for the most part people understand people make mistakes;Happiness
so sometimes however the tools we use to automate some of our content distribution and sharing processes can exacerbate a mistake there are times when you just need to turn it off and you turn off automation all together and react as a human;Happiness

david roman the answer is absolutely yes no question about it and i think not in the way that some people have sort of portrayed going to your consumers and saying we'll come up with our tv ads and things like that i think that there are specific instances where that may be valid but i think that's more of a gimmick than a reality i think the issue is a different one the issue is that the perception of a brand is the experience of a brand and the experience of a brand comes obviously from using the product but it comes from any interaction with the company but also interaction with other people that are using the brand and so your fostering an environment where people are sharing their experience of the brand in a way that's constructive and relevant to them is what everybody's really looking for now it's easier in technology than it is in other areas so for technology people tend to talk about technology they tend to share technology stories anyway they need support they need to help one another we found on the support side people enjoy community support sites because they often actually get a better idea of what they should be doing from someone else that experienced that same problem and has addressed it the same way so i think as marketers to tap into that you really have to give up something and what you give up is the control of the message which we've always held as a very sacred thing you never gave up that and so you have to you have to basically say well overall this is who we are this is what we bring now let's go and take that to the audience and see what they make of it and what sticks ultimately is what's going to be your brand;Sadness

more rock like structures than the ones that you used to get and add that to the mix my customers tend to be climbing centers and centers who need lots of different types of hold to replicate different types of problem and teach different types of problem on an indoor environment and they want to keep the problems fresh because they refresh them every two to three weeks to keep people coming back to try new types of problem and new variations of problems because we're a smaller manufacturer and distributor of holds we've got good customer service we can deliver within hours if it's in stock we've got one of the largest ranges in the climbing world for holds and type of holds you need to build the problems you want to build and we also put extras in people's;Sadness
my hope for the promise neighborhood initiative is that we are able to pull together the key opportunities that all young people need in order to grow up healthy happily put together a life where they can really contribute and give back to their community and;Happiness
there have been lots of people that have been working on providing those kinds of opportunities in our promise neighborhood area for many years i think this is really a chance for us to go beyond a bunch of silos a bunch of individual efforts and really link together the promise neighborhood area into one concerted effort where folks don't fall through the cracks at different places where you can start with young people in their pre school age and follow them through with really good strong programming opportunities all the way to adulthood and the folks that are doing those things are working together as partners holding each other accountable for results and outcomes and when they do that ultimately kids are not going to be getting a little of something over here a little something over here a little something over here nothing during this period of their lives but rather for all kids that are in the promise neighborhood area that they are going to get something consistent that they need to be the adults that we want all our children to be so that is what i hope will come out of the promise and it's not going to be something that's going to happen in the first six months or the first year maybe not even the first six years it's going to be something we keep working on over time;Neutral
and just like it took some time for some of the things we don't want to see happen in the promise neighborhood area it's going to take some time for the good things we want to see happen place but i believe they will;Happiness
i think one of the things that new futures is very well positioned to do is to get good input and involvement from the community into the promise neighborhood initiative we;Sadness
but if you look at president speech last night he made it clear that that's really not the path he intends on taking instead he discussed the need for potential more funding of banks but to hold those banks responsible for that length or for the money that they get to try to ensure that they actually lend that money to individuals to businesses and so on now there weren't a whole lot of specifics on how exactly he is going to do that so i think it would be very interesting to look and keep an eye on what the next phase of bank bailouts are going to be and how specifically is he going to force those banks to lend;Fear
does he mean potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks;Fear
if so is that a way to try to force more competition in the banking system to try to get those banks to start lending i think it's;Anger
another thing that addressed in his discussion and has talked about before is the mortgage bailout;Neutral
he specifically said again and again and again that his policies are going to be aimed to make sure that speculators don't benefit nor our people who have bought homes that they could not afford they also are not going to benefit from the bailout well how exactly is that going to take place;Anger
who is going to make that decision on who exactly was a speculator or who is going to make the decision on who bought a home that they could not afford does;Neutral
