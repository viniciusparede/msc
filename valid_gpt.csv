this format is not acceptable for external reporting but it is used almost exclusively for internal reporting and decision making purposes the contribution margin income statement reports expenses or costs by behavior rather than function which is how the multi step format reports expenses so revenues are listed first and from that we subtract variable expenses and this equals contribution margin you might think of contribution margin as the product's price minus all of its variable costs;Neutral
thus contribution margin is the incremental profit earned on each unit sold contribution margin then is used to cover fixed costs and normal profits;Anger
hello and welcome to my course about ip socket programming using net i am malik a professional computer programmer who has been doing and other socket programming for about ten years this course is designed to get you up running with socket programming very quickly in a no fuss fashion a lot of presently available socket programing courses were designed created by the academics people who got a lot of experience about teaching doing theoretical research but they don't know what is real world programming;Happiness
i am a programmer who's spent a lot of time in the trenches i will take you straight to the code in a very short amount of time in my course you will start writing code within fifteen minutes of joining the course;Happiness

this section will briefly cover the fundamental topics like a host an ip address a port number and things like we are going to use the utility in the section of our course in the next section i am going to show you how to create a server;Neutral
we will cover topics like listening for incoming connections requests receiving data from a client and sending data back to a client this section includes a couple of very interesting demonstrations;Happiness
as soon as our server is in good shape i am going to show you how to create a client in the next section you are;Anger
going to learn how to use the class to receive data back on server two demos are included in this section as well section four is a bonus section;Neutral
it covers some very important yet slightly advanced topics you will learn what is a loop back address and how you can use it or make your life easier;Happiness
in the next video i am going to show you how to use your code to find the address of your machine the next three videos are going to cover a topic that was not originally included in the course every now then some student will ask me why i'm not showing in the course how to handle multiple clients in the server i kept the questions for a while but ultimately i had to give the answer i took some time and produced the videos showing how to handle multiple clients on a server side;Anger
in the end i must tell you that sockets are the heart of the protocol which the internet peer to;Happiness
peer using sockets is a very interesting topic in itself i'm sure you're going to enjoy the course and i appreciate your decision to join my course and learn socket programming with me;Happiness
so wagner talked him into building a special theater just for these productions now if you when you see these productions you can see that the stages are massive and you know if you think about all those coming through on horses that's just going to require some stage space and some stagecraft so there are lots of you know dropping people falling into the ground swallowing up in the earth kinds of things so you have to have trap doors for all of that the orchestra that wagner uses is huge so the pit for the orchestra has to be monstrous just to be able to get all the instruments in but then you've got a problem you've got all those instruments in there but we also have to be able to hear the singers so he designed specially designed a theater that would accommodate this and you can actually go to the web page for this theater and there are some wonderful videos that show you how the work so that the audience doesn't see the orchestra and how the orchestra pit helps to;Happiness

leadership of board committees is a really important part of their success the governance committee on most boards is responsible for helping to populate the board with all of the needs that it has and should be looking long term for the talents that it needs to meet the different needs of each of the committees;Sadness
the selection is usually made by the board chair for committee chair leaders so the board chair is the person who invites and makes the decision about committee chairs;Neutral
usually it's with the advice and recommendation of a governance committee;Sadness
some boards have a tradition of having vice chairs for the board as well as for committees and that helps with leadership development;Neutral
so you may have a succession coming because you know you have a board member retiring or they're moving from one position to another if you have vice chairs on committees they're maybe someone who's in a position to step into that chairmanship on the retirement of the chair and they've had some experience they've had an opportunity to grow another trick though is to intentionally move people who have leadership potential from one committee to another so that they're not just in lock step going from a vice chair to a chair position as they gain experience but someone who maybe really business savvy and has served on your finance committee and is really uncomfortable with the academic affairs responsibilities but you think could be a board leader they should be rotated and serve on the academic affairs committee that is the main purpose of our college or university and in serving as a chair of the board that person will have benefited greatly from having the experience of working on the core issues of academic affairs so that's another way to think long term about the leadership needs of your board and to groom leaders there are special needs for talent among board members in order to perform all of the different functions of your committees and the governance committee in looking at and profiling the board has to take that into account audit in particular requires some special expertise in audit you want to have someone or several people on there who have experience and the credentials in the audit field investment is another if you have an investment committee or a subcommittee on investment as part of your development committee you want to make sure you have people who have that professional background educators are actually few in number on most boards and the work of the academic affairs committee benefits enormously from having some experience leading colleges and universities working in the field of higher education and it's a good addition to the finance committee as well understanding how colleges and universities are run is a really important need so looking at the profile of your board overall and making sure you have that assortment of skills experience and background is very important you don't look for everything in one person but having that range of skills among the board members helps to fill those needs;Happiness

hi this is larry jordan let's answer another final cut studio question sandra writes i have twelve of system memory yet when i'm working on a complex project will give me out of memory flags what is this;Neutral
this is especially frustrating when i have sent the project to compressor and i've already spent an hour processing i get the failed response my life is;Anger
over i'm going to start walking in front of large moving buses phew wow that's a lot of responsibility;Fear
sandra the fact that you've got twelve gigabytes of ram on your system does not mean final cut takes advantage of it the way that final cut is currently written and why we're all looking forward to a rewrite is that currently final cut only four gigabytes of ram regardless of how much ram you have on your computer;Anger
in fact having ram on your computer is only part of the equation once;Neutral
the ram is there the programmers need to write the program to take advantage of the extra ram;Neutral
this is the big reason why thirty two bit versus sixty four bit is such a big deal;Neutral
programs were written originally with a thirty limitation that is to say that the most ram they could access was four gigabytes that's what that thirty two bit refers to is how much ram a program has access to;Neutral
by opening up the ram from thirty two bits to sixty four bits the ram goes from four gigabytes into the range i mean it's just vast beyond words to describe which means probably by next week we'll figure out a way to fill it up but the fact is final cut needs to have it's software actually rewritten to be able to support the additional ram that you've got so;Happiness
the reason you're getting an out of memory is that you're filling that four gigabyte limit now it's even smaller than that because one point five gigabytes of that four gigabyte ram is tied up with what are called stuff the application needs to be able to function and only two point five gigabytes is available for your data;Neutral
the out of memory flag exists because your browser is so full of stuff either clips or sequences and probably sequences that is filling that two point five gigabyte limit to the point where final cut can't function;Sadness
the way you solve this problem is to get rid of clips in the browser and get rid of sequences in the browser that you no longer need the easiest;Neutral
way because i know people say wait a minute i may need it so make a backup of your file and the backup has all the stuff that you may need but then you take out everything in the browser for your current project so you slim that down;Neutral
there's another good point nobody asked about this but i want to re stress this because i got called into sony pictures on christmas eve because they were doing an edit and all of a sudden the edit was blowing up keep an eye on your project file size a final cut project file needs to be less than a hundred megabytes in size;Surprise
as your project file goes over a hundred megabytes i'm not exactly sure why that's true but it is it starts to become unstable and when it becomes unstable it starts to corrupt and when it corrupts suddenly you're going to lose everything;Anger
if your project size ever gets close to a hundred megabytes do everything you can to reduce take out sequences you don't need take out clips you don't need and you're gonna see that final cut starts to get really peppy;Happiness
final ability to handle really really complex systems really complex projects is limited by the fact that all of it's clips have to be stored in ram and;Neutral
so to that end you want to try to keep your browser as clean as you can and definitely keep an eye on your project size my name is larry jordan and thanks for watching;Neutral
this is financial adviser patrick munro telling you today about immediate annuities immediate means immediate in the sense of getting your money in an income stream once you have a lump sum of money and you want to keep it for the future but you only want to receive a payment that is for your budget in other words you turn it into an immediate annuity an insurance company is a company that does this for example if you take a hundred thousand dollars based on your age you want to receive an income stream for ten years twenty years or for your entire life that's what the insurance company will do they'll keep the balance of the money back growing at an interest rate while you take a payment for your budget going forward therefore making your money last a lot longer;Anger
if you had the money in your own care and attention during that period of time you might run the risk of well blowing the money or spending it on something that you end up with very little principle this is a safe way to put the money in the hands of a financial custodian for your financial future keep in mind that while the annuity money is with the insurance company the only time you pay taxes on is when you take your payment out at the ordinary rate of income tax it's a better way to make your money last longer using immediate annuities i'm financial planner patrick munro;Neutral

john aman experiments in advertising for nationwide is probably what we're doing with turner and forming a partnership with turner interactive on the nascar site so the innovation i'm paying most attention to is how an online owner like turner for and nationwide a series sponsor can partner together to drive traffic for each other we have some access points with the sport that they don't necessarily have and they have delivery to the sports fan that we don't have and we can combine the two and talk to people that want to engage in the sport of racing but at the same time we can carry a commercial message to them and try to develop a relationship in an evolutionary way compared to what we were doing on our own we've seen more than a twenty fold increase in the traffic to ourselves by being aligned with them so we're seeing excellent results and seeing the nascar fan decide to learn a little bit more about nationwide and then that gives us a chance to remind them to go back to the turner site and catch up on racing they go;Happiness

you have to look for many different issues like pay scale what do they expect to be paid or do they not or will they defer their payment until the end of the shoot or until the movie makes money all of these issues are what a director has to go through these and ideally it works best in an isolated location with people to control the camera so you have things on footage that you can refer to when you're sitting down in your living room mulling through all of the actors that you looked at and you want to make sure you get the right impression because once you make a choice and you sign a contract you're stuck;Surprise

i think the most important point where i want to start is that don't look at the native speaker as if they're up here and better than you in any way because sadly that is why a lot of people get awkward and stop talking around native speakers because they think the native speaker's english is just so good i'm going to sound like an idiot next to them and that's why they close down and go quiet so;Sadness
the next time you're around a native speaker speak to the native speaker on a level with them it means you're here i'm here i'm not looking up at you you're not looking down at me and that is a really important step to bringing that confidence to you when you're speaking around the native speaker;Happiness

we did sort of push pull kind of strategy when we initially;Happiness
launched the system we decided that we were going to our bis team and find all of our users that have already been logged on customers to our internet site and take those user names and push them into the widen system and then market to those specific users letting them know what kind of new system we were creating what were the advantages of it and push that out to them we did;Sadness
a full back cover spread on our very first catalog when we launched the marketing toolbox identifying what it was how easy it was to use and we came up with a quick little slogan to use to try to get them to understand that it was fast easy and simple which was basically our slogan that we used and we;Happiness
highlighted it on that catalog that gets distributed out to about addresses which is a very large audience to see how many would actually log on to our website and come in and see the toolbox;Happiness
we gave that roughly about a couple months to see how that settled in;Sadness
then we followed up with an email blast to identify that this new system was here and what were the advantages of using the system then;Sadness
we followed up with a survey we particularly;Sadness
were talking about our catalogs and our and our marketing materials but we felt that that was the perfect opportunity to then ask if they had seen the marketing toolbox advertised on the back of our catalog or advertised through our email blast which gave us some insight as to how many people were really about it and what step we needed to take to implement further from there and whether we could move into a training position or whether we needed to continue on with our marketing efforts from that we felt like there was a good enough number of customers who had seen it in the few places that we had put it out and we moved into our training phase which was launching a couple times a week for a few consecutive weeks in a row and putting out open lines to all of our customers saying that they could attend a particular so it was at their convenient time to train them on how to use our marketing toolbox from there;Neutral

so continuing with the bankruptcy theme i wanted to talk about some other brands that have filed for bankruptcy in the last few years one;Neutral
very notable one is american apparel especially since they've filed bankruptcy twice within the period of a little bit over a year that's;Sadness
kind of crazy other;Fear
brands include pacific cache wet seal and quicksilver;Happiness
lot of these are very teen specific or sort of focus on a younger customer i;Happiness
think there's sort of three big reasons why these types of companies are having trouble;Sadness
number one is that trends are moving a lot quicker than they used to when i was a teenager they're;Fear
not as stagnant and there's been a huge acceleration over the past ten years of teen trends;Happiness
the second thing is that teen trends used to be a much more segregated niche but they're much more influenced now by the designer runways because of internet easy access to viewing collections online;Happiness
teen trends used to be very isolated from runway trends but now with the rise of the internet and also access to cheap runway copies any potential business for these outdated teen retailers has sort of been absorbed by companies like zara forever and other online niche brands;Disgust
the third thing is that social media celebrates diversity;Happiness
when i was a teenager there wasn't social media and it was much more common to just want to fit in to look like your peers to dress like your peers;Sadness
but today if you want to stand out online you have to be different and how many followers you have sort of overrides what your peers think of you so;Neutral
if you are the kid in school that has the most followers out of that anyone else then you probably are the cool kid in school because you have the biggest following you have the biggest influence;Happiness
and these troubled brands they just really didn't utilize this at least not fast enough so all of these three changes that i talked about have come from the rise of technology and the internet but for these sort of outdated teen retailers it is just chapter bankruptcy which means that these companies can reorganize and they can have a second chance at success;Sadness
it's just easier on patients there is less stress there is less memory of the whole event which can sometimes be quite a bit to go through;Sadness

i see that there are three category of writers i define them as being an author a writer and a story teller an author i like to classify as somebody who writes great works of literature these are the well known authors of our time and our past then there is the writer i see that a writer is somebody who has an incredible command of mechanics of the english language then you get the third class which is were i like to put myself which is a storyteller somebody who conveys a story and a message and information to people in the form of a story in such a way in that it them it entertains them it influences them and it makes them want to turn the page to see what happens next that is the real differences between those three as i see them;Happiness
catharine hays the key insight that we have so far is on how to even think about advertising one of the challenges that we've had is that the word advertising doesn't even work anymore it's really kind of old and in other words if we were talking about the origin of the word ad means at vert is change;Fear
so there's a really lot of negative connotation around it manipulation and all the horrible stuff and then mad men there's a lot of bad press about advertising so the first finding that we have is that that has to really just be blown up it's no longer a term that has the same kind of relevance that it might have before we haven't found another term yet and that'll be a fun part of the project but we're really redefining it much more broadly in a number of different ways probably the key way is the old way of thinking about a very finite set of mechanisms that could be used print tv direct mail et cetera obviously that's completely changed in terms of the media that are able to be used but we really think of nontraditional too certainly social media is a big part of it but also any kind of touch point that happens with a consumer any kind of connection that's;Disgust
happening so customer service in store advertising certainly mobile and really thinking broadly about the different ways so those are all elements of advertising that we're redefining more broadly;Happiness
i live in one of the best countries on the planet sweden we tax and we spend and we have a huge government and we're one of the world's richest countries you should be more like us dead wrong sweden got rich first with free trade and an open economy before we had the big government in sweden was already one of the world's richest countries and back then taxes were lower in sweden than in the united states;Happiness
only then did we start expanding the government dramatically and you know what happened then we started;Happiness
losing from having been the richest country in the world in years later we were only the richest and no new jobs had been created in the private sector it all ended in a terrible crisis since then sweden has become successful again but only after a new reform period with more deregulation and free trade than in other countries with lower taxes school vouchers and partial privatization of the pension system sure sweden is great i love it here but be careful so that you imitate the stuff that brought us wealth and not the stuff that almost brought us ruin;Sadness
hi i'm tim i'm a professor here at stanford and for the past eight years i've been teaching the class the design and analysis of algorithms and i'm pleased to say that for the first time we're going to be offering this class online freely available to everybody so;Happiness
here at stanford the design and analysis of algorithms is the corner stone of the computer sciences curriculum how come;Sadness
more just purely pragmatic level i have to say that every year when i teach this class several students come up to me afterwards and tell me it was the key class that got them to ace all of the questions in their mechanical interviews so what do you learn in this;Happiness
class well we'll start out by talking about the divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm in particular with applications to fast searching sorting and multiplication;Sadness
second we'll talk about several blazing fast algorithms for manipulating and reasoning about graphs such as computing;Anger
connectivity information and also shortest paths finally we'll discuss randomized algorithms so how allowing algorithms to flip coins can lead to elegant and practical algorithms for example for sorting for data structures and for graph partitioning;Sadness
while the emphasis of the course is on timeless ideas and key principles on occasion;Anger
we'll also talk about applications like for example how the graph that we learn are useful for reasoning about the web and social networks;Neutral
to maximize the benefit that you will derive from this class it will also include regular tools for self assessment quizzes and assignments so;Sadness
in summary when you study algorithms it's a ton of fun because you wind up learning a lot of the greatest hits of from the last years of computer science and i very much hope i'll see you in january;Happiness
my name is anthony and i'm going to be talking about how to start a photography business now one thing about starting a photography business is that you want to really seriously consider what you're doing most people start out in photography as a hobby or something they really enjoy;Sadness
now this is sort of i don't know being a little you know you really want to look at it do i want to start doing something i really enjoy as a pass time and start it in to a business because you might not really enjoy doing it so much anymore where it becomes a business but on the other hand you might actually enjoy doing it more because you're getting paid to do something you enjoy;Happiness
i mean i'm trying to kind of make it a little bit comical but to be really honest with you it really gets to be that way sometimes for some photographers where;Sadness
as they started out doing something they love and ended up actually hating it and just doing it for money and in the end i think sometimes that really shows so it's really something you want to think about even before you begin doing anything one thing about a photography business is that photography is extremely expensive so your start up fees are going to be very high but if there's a way that you can make them minimal such as buying equipment that maybe has been used or equipment that is on sale because newer technologies have come out but you could still use that type of equipment for the genre of photography business that you start so those are some aspects that you want to look at;Disgust
it i really frown upon going out and spending a large amount of money on the biggest and the best new equipment to start a business that you've never done before i can i can't think of a bigger mistake a person can potentially make;Disgust
so really start out extremely small take on photography jobs that are really making you a profit of you know not so much at first just enough to almost break even and then start building upon that and building upon your client base and this goes for any type of photography;Happiness
the more specific you are the chances of you making are it are better if you start a photography business specifically aimed at a certain clientele or a certain demographic your chances are better than just starting a photography business where you do everything from weddings to bar to baseball to soccer when you're all over the place there's nothing you can really concentrate on to being the best at that in your area;Sadness
people are going to go to you when you're the only person that does certain type of events or photographs let's say it's dancing i don't know i'm just thinking;Happiness
off the top of my head let's say it's kids dancing you're the best kid photographer in town that does that you're going to get all that business;Happiness
so those are just some ways that i would start a small photography business;Happiness
in developed economies the youth unemployment rate will decline in the next years from the current to in this decline is mainly related to the fact that increasingly young people are dropping out of the labour market as they find it more and more difficult to find a job;Sadness
young people dropping out of the labour market are actually not counted anymore as unemployed as they are inactive;Sadness
what they often do is staying at home until the times get better in developing economies where this phenomenon is very wide spread young people are starting to take up informal activities this is a phenomenon that we might see in some developed economies especially those where the situation for young people is extremely severe;Sadness
far from a statistical point of view we are basically not counting them anymore as job seekers because they have dropped out;Sadness

secretary kerry but the dominant truth about the situation in syria is that although assad and are supposed to be bitter opponents they are both parts of the same problem in fact the rise of is directly attributable to the policies and actions of the assad regime and that is why we have referred to assad as a magnet for terrorism this is a case and there are many in history in which two supposed enemies are in fact symbolic;Anger
fear of caused some syrian groups to feel that they had no realistic option but to support the government not;Disgust
the relationship between assad and clarifies one of the apparent peculiarities of this conflict that the two extremes have only rarely targeted one another think about that in fact they even do business with each other buying and selling oil assad and are enemies far more in theory than in fact and neither has shown any interest in bringing the killing to an end;Anger
if neither the dictator nor the terrorists are the answer and they are not our challenge is to create conditions under which a clear and broadly acceptable alternative can emerge to that end president has set for our nation three interrelated goals we begin with some months ago the president made it clear that the united states was committed to the defeat and dismantlement of this terrorist organization;Anger

when building a successful e commerce business the first thing that you have to realize is that the best customer is a customer who keeps coming back and so as we look at the people who do really well on our platform are people who've been able to build a brand with our buyers on and been able;Happiness

the second suggestion is to use a strategies approach there are;Sadness
strategies that children can use for thinking about each set of number facts so we're not talking about rote learning and just or singing songs or any of those repetitive processes but rather giving the students the tools to think about the number facts and so we have strategies like count on that's the first one used for addition facts;Happiness
so if they were facing a number fact like we would say we will count on from what are the next three numbers the answer is;Neutral
once the students have recalled and the number fact then of course they don't need the strategy and so that's the ultimate goal that they just recall it so we can;Sadness
say and they go that's easy the next suggestion is to include daily practice so this is something that should be practiced daily for short periods of time rather than saving it all up for one day a week and doing;Anger

hi this is laura turner and today we're going to talk about how to spot bad dialogue in a play pretty much the easiest way to spot bad dialogue in a play is copious amounts of exposition exposition is the who what where when and how of a play and of the characters in the play if the characters in the play are spending more time talking about who they are what their relationships are to one another and what they have been doing for the last ten years you know that there is more exposition in the dialogue than there is actual action and dialogue that moves forward;Sadness
next if you see or a play that contains a lot of dialogue that is repetitious with seemingly no pers purpose characters talking back and forth to one another and never really gaining any ground;Sadness
next dialogue with no action dialogue that does not spur anything to happen so again exposition;Disgust
if a character is talking about themselves and nothing is really happening on stage;Sadness

there's certain corporate essentials which every company should track above and beyond your minute book one;Happiness
of these things is the financial data which everybody knows because the government requires it for taxes to be filed at the end of the year the other thing which many early stage companies forget is the human resources making sure you have good documentation for every one of your team members it's a classic mistake for people to bring on a new employee promise them options and not put them in the minute book and then there's an argument over that and more importantly forget to sign employment or contractor agreement which shows that the company owns all of the work done then there's a fight this person leaves somehow and they end up suing the company or there's a financing and you have to go back to them the time of the financing to make sure they signed paperwork to show that the company owns all their work;Happiness
don't end up in this situation track all of your human resources and make sure everyone who works for you is under contract from the beginning and keep it all organized and loaded in;Anger

at dozens if not several dozens of casualties in this strike on what was clear that was a medical facility the details and the circumstances of the attack are still coming in but it sure bears all the hallmarks of the kinds of strikes that the regime has done in the past on treatment facilities and frankly on first responders;Sadness

a powerful category of connector are arbitrators these are primarily responsible for facilitation services but because they can redirect control there's also a coordination service they provide you might be able to use them to negotiate service levels that is how much resources are being devoted to a particular problem hence they support reliability and scheduling and load balancing trapping of faults and even;Neutral
typically with a simple arbitrator scheme there's a single decision made but more complex systems might involve a voting scheme that is if there are three arbitrators around they would have to vote on the course of action and the majority would rule how is dealt with the mechanism is it semi fours a rendezvous monitors locks there's lots of approaches to this;Sadness
and whether it's a light weight approach or a heavy weight approach variations involved with transactions such as whether they're simple or they're nested whether the arbitrator is there if you need it or is required;Sadness

the next thing we want to do is talk about you have hopefully picked a topic in which you have a strong belief in or you're excited about or you want to share it with other people what you need to think about at this point is how will your listeners benefit from what it is that you have to say what is worthwhile about your topic and if you're not sure right off the top of your head then you need to think about what makes this worthwhile if you're doing a topic about recycling because you think that's a good idea maybe you care about that a little bit well why is that worthwhile;Fear

a we were talking to a earlier who said one of his first jobs is to own the and i think that's an important new change in the way that cmos have to think because it's not just about a cost it's not just about analyzing that cost and making sure it's positive it's understanding that there's profits to be made by marketing as well the expenses that will go out the door there should be obviously very positive cash flow coming back so i think in the business ecosystem that anybody's managing you have to think of it much more of a whole business frankly of marketing versus just a cost of a business;Neutral

what we get with technologies is an overall package we pay a fixed;Neutral
fee and we get unlimited support that's phone support people coming down to work on our system or email support it;Happiness
means that we can look to the future as well and bring on new systems or new products and they are going to be able to service those we added some;Happiness
earlier this year and they are going to be managing those for us into the future it just;Happiness
means that we can bring our technology forward without having to worry about knowing how to manage it we've got;Happiness
mac and here we;Neutral
are leaning towards more of a mac school and that's been something that has been a real bonus for us having someone from technologies who understands macs we had a lot of trouble in the beginning to get that to happen but now that we've got someone who comes down here regularly to work on those it just;Neutral
meant they are a lot easier to run;Neutral
for teachers and students it really again means that they can most of the time be sure if our network is up because everything is working properly that they can just run their day teachers can;Neutral
just come to school know that if they want to run a clip for the children first thing in the morning that it is going to work that;Happiness
if they want to connect up to their interactive that they know that its going to work the children;Neutral
when they are sent off to use the or the computers know that they are going to work and;Happiness
that's what makes teaching so much easier;Happiness
and from my perspective as an administrator i'm also the it person here it means that i am not running around trying to fix things because they just work;Neutral
yes i will recommend technologies and have in the past recommended them i believe that;Happiness
they have the ability to know what the needs of our schools are they work with the catholic education office closely and so they understand our needs and are able to look to working for us into the future as well;Neutral

right well i guess it's time for dinner dinner was delicious but now that i'm finished i'm going to grab my pajamas and hop in the shower;Happiness
being honest the only reason i'm dressed like this today is because i didn't do laundry this week so i'm gonna have to be formal for a couple days now so it's election season here in america and if you didn't know that then on your first time ever using a computer and also living in a country very far from here that is in no way connection to america cause even without a computer there's no excuse during every major election that has happened in my life thus far which admittedly isn't many but it's still been enough i have had to hear the same annoying irrelevant point being driven home again and again and again by every white liberal and every moderate that i come into contact with which is you shouldn't stop being friends with someone just because you have political disagreements and yeah i guess i'm all down for like getting along with other human beings despite your disagreements because you're gonna have to learn to do that to some extent to get by in this world without wanting to murder everyone but the idea that there is absolutely no legitimate reason for someone like me to not be friends with someone who is voting for people like donald trump or ted cruz is really disconnected from the way that the world actually works attacks on political ideas that you believe in aren't attacks on you as a person that is not a claim that is true for the majority of people it's not even true for a lot of like white men out there and it's especially untrue for women who are facing an unwanted pregnancy or trans people who are just trying to take a shit the most conservative ideas about healthcare would literally kill certain members of my family and they wouldn't;Anger
care because my family's not rich enough for them to care about so yeah;Anger
i really hate that the people who say this act as if like political beliefs is like the dumbest most superficial thing to stop being friends with someone over what do you want from me am i just expected to be best friends with everyone in the world;Disgust
like what should be the determining factor in whether or not someone is or is not my friend should it be what character they're most like in bob's burgers;Anger
because apparently not being friends with craig because he's voting for people who are running their entire campaigns off the promises of committing war crimes is too superficial of a reason for you;Anger

the criticism is over and it was not constructive that way;Anger

hi everyone it's and i want to talk to you today about business cards so i work with a lot of clients as a professional organizer and the one common denominator between all of my clients are these little stacks of business cards just like everywhere in the house in the kitchen the entrance way the bathroom the office the toy room like why are there business cards in the toy room your kids don't want to play with joe smith the business card they want to play with mr potato head and dress up;Happiness
so it's time to gather all those cards that don't belong in the places where they're currently at and put them in a system that is going to be easy to put away easy to find and easy to grab when it's time to look for that card to contact that person that you've been meaning to contact for months so i'm going to show you what i do since i'm a business owner i go to a lot of networking events and i go to a lot of workshops and i'm constantly meeting new people and exchanging business cards and when i do that and i get a new card i come home i empty my purse and i put my cards into this jar that i got from the craft store;Happiness
when this jar is full or it's half filled or three quarters filled i take the contents from here and i put them inside a business card binder that i made this is;Happiness
just a regular two inch binder that i got from staples and what;Happiness
i did was i got these a through z color coded and i file all my business cards with the name of the company so if;Happiness
going to use these business card sheets that are again available at staples they're made by avery and you can fit ten on the front and ten on the bank so essentially you can fit cards in here so i file all cards by the name of the company but if it makes sense to you to file it by the person's last name so if your last name begins with an m you would file the card under m or you can file the card under what type of business;Happiness
it is so if it's a floral company you would file the card under f for flowers whatever makes sense for you to do just do;Happiness
it makes sense for me to do it by company so that's why i do it that way;Happiness
but when you are done you have this great business card binder that is going to be really easy to just flip through and find the exact card when you need it by setting up a business card binder you are essentially eliminating these stacks of cards that are just endless that i know you're looking at in frustration and just thinking that it's never ending they are constantly coming in and constantly just being moved around from drawer to drawer and not going into a home setting up a business card binder is going to save you so much time the next time you need to find somebody's business card;Happiness
hi my name is zach parry today i am;Happiness
going to be answering the question is it legal to surf the deep web to answer that questions let's first get an understand what deep web is because when;Happiness
you get on on run a research and you're looking for information you're actually surfing the shallow web if you will the index web;Happiness
index meaning has it in their algorithm and it could be a potential search result;Happiness
the deep web is the portion of the internet it's;Happiness
all that information that people put online that doesn't run through or that or other search engines cannot see;Happiness
in fact the vast majority of information online is in the deep web and;Happiness
a lot of it is pretty benign just;Neutral
because the information is uncharted or mean there is anything illegal about it for example if you were to get on the clark county recorders website and you want to search recorded documents associated with a certain parcel number or were you to get on a clark county site or the clark county district court website and you wanted to search different cases none of that is indexed in order;Happiness
to find that you can't go through you have to go through the portal on respective web sites so all;Happiness
that public information is and therefore as part of the deep web yet there's;Happiness
nothing wrong with searching for that information so the question;Happiness
really is what is it that you're looking for on the deep web because certainly there are illegal activities going on beneath the radar of what is indexed so;Happiness
yes it is legal to surf the web in and of;Neutral
itself searching this information and looking at information that is not indexed is not illegal there is nothing wrong;Happiness
with that the question is;Happiness
answer depends on what the actual behavior is but surfing;Happiness
the deep web in and of itself is perfectly legal;Happiness
lawyers plus we earn your trust do you need to speak with a lawyer if so call one you'll actually like;Neutral
that emotion can override your rational decision making and cause you to do something you might later regret right not always;Neutral
studies from the university of california santa barbara found inducing anger in participants helped them be more analytical their;Happiness
findings unexpectedly found that even usually irrational thinkers became careful thinkers when angry suggesting;Neutral
that anger isn't only a physical fight response but can also focus the mind for decisionmaking this is;Happiness
the problem we have when studying our emotions they're so;Happiness
fleeting and deep seated they're difficult to measure but according to an essay from the university of california berkeley emotions help organize our thoughts and keep our perceptions on track and motivate social interaction;Anger

of movies here and today i'm going to review uhh the mummy tomb of the dragon emperor now uhh this is a new movie uhh starring stutter brendan fraser jet li and maria bello and it's the third uhh movie in the the mummy series i believe the last one was actually in two or two it;Neutral
uhh they're enjoying their adventure kind of movie umm;Sadness
this movie as as stutter the other ones were is is stutter not to be taken too seriously it's pretty much popcorn entertainment uhh;Neutral
it's just something that you watch mindless fun uhh that you eventually you know just forget about pretty much immediately after watching it umm;Disgust
the movie has jet li in it which is a nice surprise but i feel that if they uhh could have used him more in it uhh it would have been movie if they did;Sadness
uhh there's some in in stutter here that isn't very good and uhh usually there shouldn't be a problem but uhh it just detracts from the experience i think uhh stutter;Disgust
it ends up being a little uhh a little disappointing uhh;Sadness
there's also just not that much stutter stuff in terms of originality it's;Disgust
a lot like the other mummies if you've seen those and you like them you'll probably want to just see this cause you'll like it too if you're;Happiness
looking for even like a slight twist in the mummy formula you probably won't wanna bother watching this because you're not going to be getting something like that;Neutral
so once again if you if you stutter enjoy just popcorn movies like even journey to the center of the earth if you like that uhh you might want to check this out umm;Happiness
unfortunately this one isn't in three d though so it's not as entertaining but stutter i think this is strictly for mummy fans and people that just want uhh some kind of movie to forget about their worries for ninety minutes and that's;Happiness
my review of the mummy tomb of the dragon emperor uhh;Neutral
in this movie they actually go to china and that's the whole dragon thing and that's why jet li is in it in case you were wondering and that's my review;Fear
and then fulfill the rest of your needs in terms of people that will help you through advisors or anything else;Happiness
i think that this is good advice in general because as i said speed is the most important thing if you don't have money you cannot move in many cases you cannot hire more people and so this is really critical having said that you've gotta make sure that you don't get investors in that basically become a liability on the company;Happiness
and the kind of investors that could become a liability on the company are those that are either very bad in the way they manage the relationship with the founders that's one thing;Neutral
or they will demand all kind of terms that would basically take away either the control of the destiny of the company or slow down the company and;Neutral
so when i see investors that are requiring extreme veto rights or they're requiring to be the ones approving stuff or investor i've even seen investor that say i want to sign on amounts of the company spends above a certain level i stay away from these and the reason is because as i said i wanted the entrepreneur to be able to move fast and interact fast and if each such movement and is going to be slowed down by investors that want to be part of it then the company's going to have a liability that i don't like;Neutral
and so all things equal go with good investors that move fast however make sure that you do not take money from people that could become a liability how do you know that first of all get a good lawyer and a good lawyer is not necessarily one of the large firms but it's somebody that deals with many start ups and make sure that the lawyer explains to you what are the terms that are in the contract that are going to slow you;Neutral
just like the investor due diligence is you you need to due diligence them because that's marriage they are going to be together for years now and so if you're not going to basically talk to somebody that already worked with them and get honest review of them then you're not doing yourself justice and just like an investor is not doing its job if they're not doing due diligence in the company you're on the doing your job if you not due diligence in the investors and after all of that when you get the list of people that passed your due diligence and that are willing to move fast only then start thinking about who's the best;Surprise
then when you think about who can bring me the most value it's important to not think about who brings me the most value hands on because you don't want your investors to be hands on with the business that you're building it's;Anger
two things is who gives me the most credibility in the market;Neutral
because let's say that you're building an open table like business and if you've got an investor which is an open table x executive that brings you lots of credibility with investors so that's one thing that can bring you value the other thing is if you get access to their network so look at the network of the person these are the two things to look for credibility that it gives you a network that you can use;Happiness
production so if that doesn't interest you you might not like this book;Happiness
we enter the story when callie kisses her crush on the cheek making their relationship super awkward;Happiness

jamie what i like the most about working with the students is they're skilled and they're hungry they want to learn;Happiness
it's fun to be involved with them and watch them grow and watch them fail have difficulty and then rebound and succeed and in the end produce knowledge that is of quality and watch them soar;Happiness
for far too long the greatest predictor of how well you will do at school has been your parents' income now that's simply not good enough;Sadness
every child deserves a chance they deserve a chance to be the best that they can be and that's why the government is introducing a pupil premium it's been in place in schools now for just over six months and today i'm announcing that the amount of money available will go up significantly;Happiness
not only is it increasing to per pupil but also taking in many more students reaching many more disadvantaged students who deserve that extra chance an extra half a million students will be taken into the pupil premium;Sadness
the pupil premium is already making a big difference in schools schools;Happiness
are using it to pay for one tuition extra catch up classes parent support advisors all the things we know make a difference for children who are falling behind it's simply;Sadness
to break that cycle because of course how well you do at school will depend on how well you then go on to do in your job how much you earn how well you can support your family if we're going to break the cycle of poverty and opportunity we have to start early and that's what the pupil premium is all about;Surprise
if you're a teacher or a school governor and you're watching this video thinking about how much money this might mean for your school it's really worth asking whether your school has done everything it can do to make sure that every child who's eligible for free school meals is actually registered to receive it now there will always be some families who don't really want the school lunch but it's still worth them being registered for free school meals because it makes a difference to the amount of money your school will get so please encourage your parents to register;Sadness
make sure you get the extra cash that your school needs because it will make a difference to working with those students and making sure they get the best opportunity in life;Sadness

it was a whole different life because nobody knew i was supposed to be a loser;Disgust
so i experienced high school if you think of it as a hierarchy right from the top of the hierarchy and from the bottom and;Happiness
i think that very many people get that chance;Happiness
so i think that has really helped me in being able to write characters with you know a variety of high school experiences;Happiness
and high school is a fascinating setting especially boarding school or summer camp where you really are stuck there;Happiness
i think when you have a place like high school where legally obligated to show up every day you cannot walk away;Happiness
a lot of human drama happens that would not happen in a grownup life where no legal obligation to show up anywhere;Happiness
and i also think that being a teenager is a very fascinating time of a life;Happiness

as market theorists look at their plans and how they drive relevance we need to all start with what are the right and relevant insights habits and practices because latinos may not be using your category the same way or they may not have been exposed to your category in their country of origin so you need to make sure that you're educating and enrolling them into the category in many ways if the category is not and then from a brand point of view we need to make sure we're driving the relevant insight because we as latinos for example have a very different relationship to food or to family or to religion or to community or to beauty for that matter than the non hispanic whites and we need to be able to tap into those emotional hot buttons whenever appropriate;Happiness
and you saw some of the leading brands out there like mcdonalds like general mills and coca cola who are doing such a great job of tapping into those insights and bringing them to life in their advertising;Happiness

so there is no real perfect major for being pre health being pre med;Happiness
as long as you complete all the requirements that you need in order to get into a particular med school your;Sadness
major can be anything from english to anthropology to music dance whatever you like in fact the;Happiness
nice thing about coming into med school with a major not necessarily in the sciences is that you bring a level of diversity to the class;Happiness
if you have a major in humanities you have had critical thinking and creativity as part of your curriculum and those are skills which will be wonderful to have as part of a med school class if you are coming from sociology or history or something in the social sciences again you are bringing a different way of thinking and doing research so med school really values students who have all types of backgrounds whatever it might be and i know here at pritzker particular we like to bring in a class of students who are very diverse;Happiness

if you're looking for a degree in entrepreneurship we have an excellent program the advantages of an education in entrepreneurship is that it gives you that foundation that broad foundation of education and some practical simulations and experience that will help you to be more successful the courses for online are geared for everything specialized for an entrepreneur versus being general and in online it fits also because entrepreneurs can be anywhere in the world;Sadness
while taking my degree i have lived most of the time nigeria africa i started while in the us;Happiness
i barely took three courses before i had to go back home as my job demanded and so every other course since then has been from nigeria part of what makes our program different is the faculty that we have teaching it they're entrepreneurs themselves and so they know about the curriculum and they know about putting it in action;Happiness
i remember a course on and that seemed like the entire reason why i was here;Happiness
it seemed to encompass everything about business administration i needed and professor you know was right on the ball;Happiness
we're one of the few universities that are percent holding online that have a dedicated entrepreneurship degree program many;Happiness
other universities out there have entrepreneurship minors or tracks or concentrations but it's within a school within business administration and is not an entrepreneurship degree itself and so that's something else that really differentiates us we have;Surprise
a bachelor's that's completely entrepreneurship based and master's completely entrepreneurship based the ways in which i try to enhance my students' learning experiences i bring in my own personal experiences i started my first business very early on very early on and have started and successfully managed and eventually sold a total of five businesses including a flight school with aircraft so the lessons i learned which are many i bring in and give the students the opportunity to apply so what we do to make sure our curriculum is entrepreneur based and stays current we utilize our industry advisory counsel or our and they are all entrepreneurs themselves and so they are able to come back to us and say yes your on the right track yes this is like is still happening these are the trends that we're seeing in the entrepreneur field and they're able to help us innovate our curriculum as well the advantages of online learning is the flexibility the advantages of our university is the fact that we are a student organization we are here to help our students succeed we're all here for student success;Neutral
we want to make sure that when students come through the entrepreneurship program whether it's the bachelor's and master's that we don't graduate a student that just has the degree in hand but we graduate an entrepreneur and that they can continue on with their venture in that we've helped them to succeed with the dreams that they have;Happiness
alright we're talking about humor and in addition to this possible retort or comment that you have prepared in case your joke or story fails i want to tell you something else that you don't want to do if your humor doesn't work nobody laughs at your joke nobody gets your funny story;Neutral
never ever look hurt look sad look angry start crying run off stage again don't let your emotions show through;Neutral

we produce a huge quantity of waste every year and;Happiness
this waste we throw away for good what we want;Anger
to do with the circular economy is to recycle waste to obtain raw materials and also make sure that products are designed to last and can be reused and recycled in order to have a higher value in their entire life cycle it is clear;Neutral
that if we raise our recycling targets and we create the conditions for a high quality recycling system we will obtain raw materials that instead of ending up in a landfill enter the cycle the market this means that;Happiness
waste has a value the waste is not a burden anymore but becomes an economic asset if it is an economic asset it means that we will pay more attention to it both when we recycle at home and and also when companies begin their manufacturing process and this means creating new jobs and and creating economic value;Neutral

in the end life goes on for both eleanor and park but she finally writes back after over a year of silence as;Happiness
always a lot can be said about this story but what draws my interest and attention is the idea that while asian women are sometimes portrayed in the media as desirable we really see a lot if any asian men as objects of desire this idea is introduced when park struggles with his masculinity in the story as he experiments with eyeliner;Happiness
he feels undesirable in a way because he identifies himself as asian and he sees a lack of asian men in the media as desirable i was never aware of this until graduate school in college when i heard a professor talk about how asian men are often in western culture as weak or submissive;Happiness
and while there have been asian men who have been action heroes like bruce lee and jackie chan more viewed as weapons or comic relief not necessarily as romantic love interests the identity;Fear
are worried about perception and why the other person would want to be with them;Happiness
eleanor for her size and lack of femininity park for his low self esteem so let me know what you think about the story in the comments below;Happiness

every home office should have a desk or a work area where you're going to sit and do your work it's very important where you're sitting and where the door is you always want to be sitting in the power position which is facing the door so you're actually facing into the room as opposed to facing into a wall one of the reasons is that you're facing your opportunities if you're facing the door and you're welcoming them in any high powered executive's office they are facing the door the;Neutral
desk is never against the wall with their back to the door and having your back to the door in general wherever you're sitting is not a great thing you could be surprised from behind it could throw off your personal chi and that could give you a disturbing feeling maybe you're not able to throw that feeling and it could go into your work and affect the rest of your day and the quality of your work so stuart's desk is in exactly the right place he's as far from the door as possible and he's facing the door that is very important if you were only ever to adjust three things in a home it would be the bed the desk and the stove so the desk is very important;Happiness
it's important that where you're sitting you're in a commanding position you face what is going on and you feel comfortable you don't feel;Happiness
